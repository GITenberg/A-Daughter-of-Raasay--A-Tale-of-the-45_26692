<p>FOREWORD</p>
</div>

<p>When this romance touches history the author
believes that it is, in every respect,
with one possible exception, in accord with
the accepted facts. In detailing the history of &#8220;the
&#8216;45&#8217;&#8221; and the sufferings of the misguided gentlemen
who flung away the scabbard out of loyalty to a
worthless cause, care has been taken to make the
story agree with history. The writer does not of
course indorse the view of Prince Charles&#8217; character
herein set forth by Kenneth Montagu, but there is
abundant evidence to show that the Young Chevalier
had in a very large degree those qualities which were
lacking to none of the Stuarts: a charming personality
and a gallant bearing. If his later life did not fulfil
the promise of his youth, the unhappy circumstances
which hampered him should be kept in mind as an
extenuation.</p>
<p>The thanks of the writer are due for pertinent criticism
to Miss Chase, to Mr. Arthur Chapman and to
Mr. James Rain, and especially to Mr. Ellery Sedgwick,
whose friendly interest and kindly encouragement
have been unfailing.</p>
<p>Acknowledgment must also be made of a copious
use of Horace Walpole&#8217;s Letters, the Chevalier Johnstone&#8217;s
History of the Rebellion, and other eighteenth
century sources of information concerning the incidents
of the times. The author has taken the liberty
of using several anecdotes and <i>bon mots</i> mentioned in
the &#8220;Letters&#8221;; but he has in each case put the story
in the mouth of its historical originator.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>THE SPORT OF CHANCE</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Deep play!&#8221; I heard Major Wolfe whisper
to Lord Balmerino. &#8220;Can Montagu&#8217;s estate
stand such a drain?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. He will be dipped to the last pound before
midnight. &#8217;Tis Volney&#8217;s doing. He has angled for
Montagu a se&#8217;nnight, and now he has hooked him.
I have warned the lad, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>The Scotchman was right. I was past all caution
now, past all restraint. The fever of play had gripped
me, and I would listen to nothing but the rattle of that
little box which makes the most seductive music ever
sung by siren. My Lord Balmerino might stand behind
me in silent protest till all was grey, and though
he had been twenty times my father&#8217;s friend he would
not move me a jot.</p>
<p>Volney&#8217;s smoldering eyes looked across the table
at me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your cast, Kenn. Shall we say doubles? You&#8217;ll
nick this time for sure.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Done! Nine&#8217;s the main,&#8221; I cried, and threw
deuces.</p>
<p>With that throw down crashed fifty ancestral oaks
that had weathered the storms of three hundred winters.
I had crabbed, not nicked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fickle goddess is not with you to-day, Kenn.
The jade jilts us all at times,&#8221; drawled Volney, as he
raked in his winnings carelessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet I have noted that there are those whom she
forsakes not often, and I have wondered by what
charmed talisman they hold her true,&#8221; flashed out
Balmerino.</p>
<p>The steel flickered into Volney&#8217;s eyes. He understood
it for no chance remark, but as an innuendo
tossed forth as a challenge. Of all men Sir Robert
Volney rode on the crest of fortune&#8217;s wave, and there
were not lacking those who whispered that his invariable
luck was due to something more than chance
and honest skill. For me, I never believed the charge.
With all his faults Volney had the sportsman&#8217;s love of
fair play.</p>
<p>The son of a plain country gentleman, he had come
to be by reason of his handsome face, his reckless
courage, his unfailing impudence, and his gift of
<i>savoir-vivre</i>, the most notorious and fortunate of the
adventurers who swarmed at the court of St. James.
By dint of these and kindred qualities he had become
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
an intimate companion of the Prince of Wales. The
man had a wide observation of life; indeed, he was
an interested and whimsical observer rather than an
actor, and a scoffer always. A libertine from the head
to the heel of him, yet gossip marked him as the
future husband of the beautiful young heiress Antoinette
Westerleigh. For the rest, he carried an
itching sword and the smoothest tongue that ever
graced a villain. I had been proud that such a man
had picked me for his friend, entirely won by the
charm of manner that made his more evil faults sit
gracefully on him.</p>
<p>Volney declined for the present the quarrel that
Balmerino&#8217;s impulsive loyalty to me would have fixed
on him. He feared no living man, but he was no hothead
to be drawn from his purpose. If Lord Balmerino
wanted to measure swords with him he would accommodate
the old Scotch peer with the greatest
pleasure on earth, but not till the time fitted him. He
answered easily:</p>
<p>&#8220;I know no talisman but this, my Lord; in luck
and out of luck to bear a smiling front, content with
the goods the gods may send.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a fair hit, for Balmerino was well known
as an open malcontent and suspected of being a
Jacobite.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! The goods sent by the gods! A pigeon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
for the plucking&mdash;the lad you have called friend!&#8221;
retorted the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take care, my Lord,&#8221; warningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But there are birds it is not safe to pluck,&#8221;
continued Balmerino, heedless of his growing
anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As even Sir Robert Volney may find out. An
eaglet is not wisely chosen for such purpose.&#8221;</p>
<p>It irritated me that they should thrust and parry
over my shoulder, as if I had been but a boy instead
of full three months past my legal majority. Besides,
I had no mind to have them letting each other&#8217;s blood
on my account.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rat it, &#8217;tis your play, Volney. You keep us
waiting,&#8221; I cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re in a devilish hurry to be quit of your
shekels,&#8221; laughed the Irishman O&#8217;Sullivan, who sat
across the table from me. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t there a proverb, Mr.
Montagu, about a&mdash;a careless gentleman and his
money going different ways, begad? Don&#8217;t keep him
waiting any longer than need be, Volney.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is this to be said for the Macaronis, that they
plucked their pigeon with the most graceful negligence
in the world. They might live by their wits,
but they knew how to wear always the jauntiest indifference
of manner. Out came the feathers with a sure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
hand, the while they exchanged choice <i>bon mots</i> and
racy scandal. Hazard was the game we played and
I, Kenneth Montagu, was cast for the rôle of the
pigeon. Against these old gamesters I had no chance
even if the play had been fair, and my head on it more
than one of them rooked me from start to finish. I
was with a vast deal of good company, half of whom
were rogues and blacklegs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heard George Selwyn&#8217;s latest?&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> inquired Lord
Chesterfield languidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not I. Threes, devil take it!&#8221; cried O&#8217;Sullivan
in a pet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell it, Horry. It&#8217;s your story,&#8221; drawled the
fourth Earl of Chesterfield.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith, and that&#8217;s soon done,&#8221; answered Walpole.
&#8220;George and I were taking the air down the Mall
arm in arm yesterday just after the fellow Fox was
hanged for cutting purses, and up comes our Fox to
quiz George. Says he, knowing Selwyn&#8217;s penchant
for horrors, &#8216;George, were you at the execution of
my namesake?&#8217; Selwyn looks him over in his droll
way from head to foot and says,  &#8216;Lard, no! I never
attend rehearsals, Fox.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis the first he has missed for years then.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
Selwyn is as regular as Jack Ketch himself. Your
throw, Montagu,&#8221; put in O&#8217;Sullivan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven&#8217;s the main, and by the glove of Helen I
crab. Saw ever man such cursed luck?&#8221; I cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis vile. Luck&#8217;s mauling you fearfully to-night,&#8221;
agreed Volney languidly. Then, apropos of
the hanging, &#8220;Ketch turned off that fellow Dr. Dodd
too. There was a shower, and the prison chaplain
held an umbrella over Dodd&#8217;s head. Gilly Williams
said it wasn&#8217;t necessary, as the Doctor was going to a
place where he might be easily dried.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Egad, &#8217;tis his greatest interest in life,&#8221; chuckled
Walpole, harking back to Selwyn. &#8220;When George
has a tooth pulled he drops his kerchief as a signal
for the dentist to begin the execution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Old Lord Pam&#8217;s toothless gums grinned appreciation
of the jest as he tottered from the room to take a
chair for a rout at which he was due.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith, and it&#8217;s a wonder how that old Methuselah
hangs on year after year,&#8221; said O&#8217;Sullivan bluntly, before
the door had even closed on the octogenarian.
&#8220;He must be a thousand if he&#8217;s a day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact is,&#8221; explained Chesterfield confidentially,
&#8220;that old Pam has been dead for several years, but
he doesn&#8217;t choose to have it known. Pardon me, am
I delaying the game?&#8221;</p>
<p>He was not, and he knew it; but my Lord Chesterfield
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
was far too polite to more than hint to Topham
Beauclerc that he had fallen asleep over his
throw. Selwyn and Lord March lounged into the
coffee house arm in arm. On their heels came Sir
James Craven, the choicest blackleg in England.</p>
<p>&#8220;How d&#8217;ye do, everybody? Whom are you and
O&#8217;Sully rooking to-night, Volney? Oh, I see&mdash;Montagu.
Beg pardon,&#8221; said Craven coolly.</p>
<p>Volney looked past the man with a wooden face
that did not even recognize the fellow as a blot on
the landscape. There was bad blood between the two
men, destined to end in a tragedy. Sir James had
been in the high graces of Frederick Prince of Wales
until the younger and more polished Volney had
ousted him. On the part of the coarse and burly
Craven, there was enduring hatred toward his easy
and elegant rival, who paid back his malice with a
serene contempt. Noted duellist as Craven was, Sir
Robert did not give a pinch of snuff for his rage.</p>
<p>The talk veered to the new fashion of spangled
skirts, and Walpole vowed that Lady Coventry&#8217;s new
dress was covered with spangles big as a shilling.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twill be convenient for Coventry. She&#8217;ll be
change for a guinea,&#8221; suggested Selwyn gloomily, his
solemn face unlighted by the vestige of a smile.</p>
<p>So they jested, even when the play was deepest and
while long-inherited family manors passed out of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
hands of their owners. The recent French victory at
<i>Fontenoy</i> still rankled in the heart of every Englishman.
Within, the country seethed with an undercurrent
of unrest and dissatisfaction. It was said that
there were those who boasted quietly among themselves
over their wine that the sun would yet rise
some day on a Stuart England, that there were desperate
men still willing to risk their lives in blind loyalty
or in the gambler&#8217;s spirit for the race of Kings
that had been discarded for its unworthiness. But the
cut of his Mechlin lace ruffles was more to the Macaroni
than his country&#8217;s future. He made his jest with
the same aplomb at births and weddings and deaths.</p>
<p>Each fresh minute of play found me parted from
some heirloom treasured by Montagus long since
dust. In another half hour Montagu Grange was
stripped of timber bare as the Row itself. Once, between
games, I strolled uneasily down the room, and
passing the long looking glass scarce recognized the
haggard face that looked out at me. Still I played
on, dogged and wretched, not knowing how to withdraw
myself from these elegant dandies who were
used to win or lose a fortune at a sitting with imperturbable
face.</p>
<p>Lord Balmerino gave me a chance. He clapped a
hand on my shoulder and said in his brusque kindly
way&mdash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Enough, lad! You have dropped eight thou&#8217; to-night.
Let the old family pictures still hang on the
walls.&#8221;</p>
<p>I looked up, flushed and excited, yet still sane
enough to know his advice was good. In the strong
sallow face of Major James Wolfe I read the same
word. I knew the young soldier slightly and liked
him with a great respect, though I could not know
that this grave brilliant-eyed young man was later to
become England&#8217;s greatest soldier and hero. I had
even pushed back my chair to rise from the table
when the cool gibing voice of Volney cut in.</p>
<p>&#8220;The eighth wonder of the world; Lord Balmerino
in a new rôle&mdash;adviser to young men of fashion
who incline to enjoy life. Are you by any chance
thinking of becoming a ranting preacher, my
Lord?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I bid him do as I say and not as I have done.
To point my case I cite myself as an evil example of
too deep play.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, my Lord! Faith, I fancied you had in
mind even deeper play for the future. A vastly
interesting game, this of politics. You stake your
head that you can turn a king and zounds! you play
the deuce instead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Balmerino looked at him blackly out of a face cut
in frowning marble, but Volney leaned back carelessly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
in his chair and his insolent eyes never
flickered.</p>
<p>As I say, I sat swithering &#8217;twixt will and will-not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better come, Kenneth! The luck is against you
to-night,&#8221; urged Balmerino, his face relaxing as he
turned to me.</p>
<p>Major Wolfe said nothing, but his face too invited
me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, better go back to school and be birched,&#8221;
sneered Volney.</p>
<p>And at that I flung back into my seat with a curse,
resolute to show him I was as good a man as he. My
grim-faced guardian angel washed his hands of me
with a Scotch proverb.</p>
<p>&#8220;He that will to Cupar maun to Cupar. The lad
will have to gang his ain gate,&#8221; I heard him tell
Wolfe as they strolled away.</p>
<p>Still the luck held against me. Before I rose from
the table two hours later I wrote out notes for a total
so large that I knew the Grange must be mortgaged
to the roof to satisfy it.</p>
<p>Volney lolled in his chair and hid a yawn behind
tapering pink finger-nails. &#8220;&#8217;Slife, you had a cursed
run of the ivories to-night, Kenn! When are you
for your revenge? Shall we say to-morrow? Egad,
I&#8217;m ready to sleep round the clock. Who&#8217;ll take a
seat in my coach? I&#8217;m for home.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></p>
<p>I pushed into the night with a burning fever in my
blood, and the waves of damp mist which enveloped
London and beat upon me, gathering great drops of
moisture on my cloak, did not suffice to cool the fire
that burnt me up. The black dog Care hung heavy on
my shoulders. I knew now what I had done. Fool
that I was, I had mortgaged not only my own heritage
but also the lives of my young brother Charles and
my sister Cloe. Our father had died of apoplexy
without a will, and a large part of his personal
property had come to me with the entailed estate.
The provision for the other two had been of the
slightest, and now by this one wild night of play I
had put it out of my power to take care of them. I
had better clap a pistol to my head and be done with it.</p>
<p>Even while the thought was in my mind a hand out
of the night fell on my shoulder from behind. I
turned with a start, and found myself face to face with
the Scotchman Balmerino.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whither away, Kenneth?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>I laughed bitterly. &#8220;What does it matter? A
broken gambler&mdash;a ruined dicer&mdash; What is there
left for him?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Scotch Lord linked an arm through mine. I
had liefer have been alone, but I could scarce tell him
so. He had been a friend of my father and had done
his best to save me from my folly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There is much left. All is not lost. I have a
word to say to your father&#8217;s son.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What use!&#8221; I cried rudely. &#8220;You would lock
the stable after the horse is stolen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say rather that I would put you in the way of
getting another horse,&#8221; he answered gravely.</p>
<p>So gravely that I looked at him twice before I
answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;And I would be blithe to find a way, for split
me! as things look now I must either pistol myself or
take to the road and pistol others,&#8221; I told him
gloomily.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are worse things than to lose one&#8217;s
wealth&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear you say it, but begad! I do not know
them,&#8221; I answered with a touch of anger at his calmness.</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;When the way is open to regain all one has
lost and more,&#8221; he finished, unheeding my interruption.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this way you speak of,&#8221; I cried impatiently.
&#8220;Where is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at me searchingly, as one who would
know the inmost secrets of my soul. Under a guttering
street light he stopped me and read my face line
by line. I dare swear he found there a recklessness
to match his own and perhaps some trace of the
loyalty for which he looked. Presently he said, as
the paving stones echoed to our tread:&mdash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You have your father&#8217;s face, Kenn. I mind him a
lad just like you when we went out together in the
&#8217;15 for the King. Those were great days&mdash;great
days. I wonder&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>His unfinished sentence tailed out into a meditative
silence. His voice and eyes told of a mind reminiscent
of the past and perhaps dreamful of the future.
Yet awhile, and he snatched himself back into the
present.</p>
<p>&#8220;Six hours ago I should not have proposed this
desperate remedy for your ills. You had a stake in
the country then, but now you are as poor in this
world&#8217;s gear as Arthur Elphinstone himself. When
one has naught but life at stake he will take greater
risks. I have a man&#8217;s game to play. Are you for it, lad?&#8221;</p>
<p>I hesitated, a prophetic divination in my mind that
I stood in a mist at the parting of life&#8217;s ways.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have thrown all to-night&mdash;and lost. I offer
you another cut at Fortune&#8217;s cards. You might even
turn a king.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said it with a quiet steadfastness in which I seemed
to detect an undercurrent of strenuous meaning. I
stopped, and in my turn looked long at him. What
did he mean? Volney&#8217;s words came to my mind. I
began to piece together rumours I had heard but never
credited. I knew that even now men dreamed of a
Stuart restoration. If Arthur Elphinstone of Balmerino
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
were one of these I knew him to be of a reckless
daring mad enough to attempt it.</p>
<p>&#8220;My Lord, you say I might turn a king,&#8221; I repeated
slowly. &#8220;&#8217;Tis more like that I would play the
knave. You speak in riddles. I am no guesser of
them. You must be plain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still he hung back from a direct answer. &#8220;You are
dull to-night, Kenn. I have known you more gleg at
the uptake, but if you will call on me to-morrow
night I shall make all plain to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>We were arrived at the door of his lodgings, a mean
house in a shabby neighbourhood, for my Lord was
as poor as a church mouse despite his title. I left him
here, and the last words I called over my shoulder to
him were,</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember, I promise nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>It may be surmised that as I turned my steps back
toward my rooms in Arlington Street I found much
matter for thought. I cursed the folly that had led
me to offer myself a dupe to these hawks of the
gaming table. I raged in a stress of heady passion
against that fair false friend Sir Robert Volney. And
always in the end my mind jumped back to dally with
Balmerino&#8217;s temptation to recoup my fallen fortunes
with one desperate throw.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fraoch! Dh &#8217;aindeoin co theireadh e!&#8221; (The
Heath! Gainsay who dare!)
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>The slogan echoed and reechoed through the silent
streets, and snatched me in an instant out of the
abstraction into which I had fallen. Hard upon the
cry there came to me the sound of steel ringing upon
steel. I legged it through the empty road, flung myself
round a corner, and came plump upon the combatants.
The defendant was a lusty young fellow
apparently about my own age, of extraordinary
agility and no mean skill with the sword. He was
giving a good account of himself against the four
assailants who hemmed him against the wall, his point
flashing here and there with swift irregularity to daunt
their valiancy. At the moment when I appeared to
create a diversion one of the four had flung himself
down and forward to cling about the knees of their
victim with intent to knife him at close quarters. The
young man dared not shorten his sword length to
meet this new danger. He tried to shake off the
man, caught at his white throat and attempted to force
him back, what time his sword still opposed the rest
of the villains.</p>
<p>Then I played my small part in the entertainment.
One of the rascals screamed out an oath at sight of
me and turned to run. I pinked him in the shoulder,
and at the same time the young swordsman fleshed
another of them. The man with the knife scrambled
to his feet, a ludicrous picture of ghastly terror. To
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
make short, in another minute there was nothing to be
seen of the cutpurses but flying feet scampering
through the night.</p>
<p>The young gentleman turned to me with a bow
that was never invented out of France. I saw now
that he was something older than myself, tall, well-made,
and with a fine stride to him that set off the
easy grace of his splendid shoulders. His light steady
blue eyes and his dark ruddy hair proclaimed him the
Highlander. His face was not what would be called
handsome: the chin was over-square and a white scar
zigzagged across his cheek, but I liked the look of
him none the less for that. His frank manly countenance
wore the self-reliance of one who has lived among
the hills and slept among the heather under countless
stars. For dress he wore the English costume with
the extra splash of colour that betokened the vanity
of his race. &#8220;&#8217;Fore God, sir, you came none too
soon,&#8221; he cried in his impetuous Gaelic way. &#8220;This
riff-raff of your London town had knifed me in another
gliff. I will be thinking that it would have gone
ill with me but for your opportune arrival. I am
much beholden to you, and if ever I can pay the debt
do not fail to call on Don&mdash;er&mdash;James Brown.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the last words he fell to earth most precipitately,
all the fervent ring dropping out of his voice. Now
James Brown is a common name enough, but he happened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
to be the first of the name I had ever heard
crying a Highland slogan in the streets of London,
and I looked at him with something more than
curiosity. I am a Scotchman myself on the mother&#8217;s
side, so that I did not need to have a name put to his
nationality.</p>
<p>There was the touch of a smile on my face when I
asked him if he were hurt. He gave me the benefit
of his full seventy three inches and told me no, that
he would think shame of himself if he could not keep
his head with his hands from a streetful of such scum.
And might he know the name of the unknown friend
who had come running out of the night to lend him
an arm?</p>
<p>&#8220;Kenneth Montagu,&#8221; I told him, laughing at his enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, Mr. Kenneth Montagu, it&#8217;s the good
friend you&#8217;ve been to me this night, and I&#8217;ll not be
forgetting it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I find myself attacked by footpads I&#8217;ll just
look up Mr. James Brown,&#8221; I told him dryly with intent
to plague.</p>
<p>He took the name sourly, no doubt in an itching to
blurt out that he was a Mac-something or other. To
a Gaelic gentleman like him the Sassenach name he
used for a convenience was gall and wormwood.</p>
<p>We walked down the street together, and where our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
ways parted near Arlington Street he gave me his
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lucky man am I at meeting you, Mr. Montagu,
while we were having the bit splore down the
street. I was just weanying for a lad handy with his
blade, and the one I would be choosing out of all England
came hot-foot round the corner.&#8221;</p>
<p>I made nothing of what I had done, but yet his
Highland friendliness and flatteries were balm to a
sick heart and we parted at my door with a great deal
of good-will.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>A CRY IN THE NIGHT</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Past ten o&#8217;clock, and a clear starry night!&#8221;
the watch was bawling as I set out from my
rooms to keep my appointment with Lord Balmerino.
I had little doubt that a Stuart restoration
was the cause for which he was recruiting, and all day
I had balanced in my mind the pros and cons of such
an attempt. I will never deny that the exiled race
held for me a strong fascination. The Stuarts may
have been weak, headstrong Kings in their prosperity,
but they had the royal virtue of drawing men to
them in their misfortune. They were never so well
loved, nor so worthy of it, as when they lived in exile
at St. Germains. Besides, though I had never mixed
with politics, I was a Jacobite by inheritance. My
father had fought for a restoration, and my uncle had
died for it.</p>
<p>There were no fast bound ties to hold me back.
Loyalty to the Hanoverians had no weight with me.
I was a broken man, and save for my head could lose
nothing by the venture. The danger of the enterprise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
was a merit in my eyes, for I was in the mood
when a man will risk his all on an impulse.</p>
<p>And yet I hung back. After all an Englishman,
be he never so desperate, does not fling away the scabbard
without counting the cost. Young as I was I
grued at the thought of the many lives that would be
cut off ere their time, and in my heart I distrusted the
Stuarts and doubted whether the game were worth the
candle.</p>
<p>I walked slowly, for I was not yet due at the lodgings
of Balmerino for an hour, and as I stood hesitating
at a street corner a chaise sheered past me at a
gallop. Through the coach window by the shine of
the moon I caught one fleeting glimpse of a white
frightened girl-face, and over the mouth was clapped a
rough hand to stifle any cry she might give. I am no
Don Quixote, but there never was a Montagu who
waited for the cool second thought to crowd out the
strong impulse of the moment. I made a dash at the
step, missed my footing, and rolled over into the mud.
When I got to my feet again the coach had stopped
at the far end of the street. Two men were getting
out of the carriage holding between them a slight
struggling figure. For one instant the clear shrill cry
of a woman was lifted into the night, then it was cut
short abruptly by the clutch of a hand at the throat.</p>
<p>I scudded toward them, lugging at my sword as I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
ran, but while I was yet fifty yards away the door of
the house opened and closed behind them. An instant,
and the door reopened to let out one of the
men, who slammed it behind him and entered the
chaise. The postilion whipped up his horses and
drove off. The door yielded nothing to my hand.
Evidently it was locked and bolted. I cried out to
open, and beat wildly upon the door with the hilt of
my sword. Indeed, I quite lost my head, threatening,
storming, and abusing. I might as well have called
upon the marble busts at the Abbey to come forth,
for inside there was the silence of the dead. Presently
lights began to glimmer in windows along the
dark street, and nightcapped heads were thrust out to
learn what was ado. I called on them to join me in a
rescue, but I found them not at all keen for the adventure.
They took me for a drunken Mohawk or
some madman escaped from custody.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here come the watch to take him away,&#8221; I heard
one call across the street to another.</p>
<p>I began to realize that an attempt to force an entrance
was futile. It would only end in an altercation
with the approaching watch. Staid citizens were
already pointing me out to them as a cause of the disturbance.
For the moment I elected discretion and
fled incontinent down the street from the guard.</p>
<p>But I was back before ten minutes were up, lurking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
in the shadows of opposite doorways, examining the
house from front and rear, searching for some means
of ingress to this mysterious dwelling. I do not
know why the thing stuck in my mind. Perhaps
some appealing quality of youth in the face and voice
stirred in me the instinct for the championship of
dames that is to be found in every man. At any rate
I was grimly resolved not to depart without an explanation
of the strange affair.</p>
<p>What no skill of mine could accomplish chance did
for me. While I was inviting a crick in my neck
from staring up at the row of unlighted windows
above me, a man came out of the front door and
stood looking up and down the street. Presently he
spied me and beckoned. I was all dishevelled and
one stain of mud from head to foot.</p>
<p>&#8220;D&#8217; ye want to earn a shilling, fellow?&#8221; he called.</p>
<p>I grumbled that I was out of work and money.
Was it likely I would refuse such a chance? And
what was it he would have me do?</p>
<p>He led the way through the big, dimly-lighted hall
to an up-stairs room near the back of the house.
Two heavy boxes were lying there, packed and
corded, to be taken down-stairs. I tossed aside my
cloak and stooped to help him. He straightened with
a jerk. I had been standing in the shadow with my
soiled cloak wrapped about me, but now I stood revealed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
in silken hose, satin breeches, and laced doublet.
If that were not enough to proclaim my rank a
rapier dangled by my side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rot me, you&#8217;re a gentleman,&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>I affected to carry off my shame with bluster.</p>
<p>&#8220;What if I am!&#8221; I cried fiercely. &#8220;May not a
gentleman be hungry, man? I am a ruined dicer, as
poor as a church mouse. Do you grudge me my
shilling?&#8221;</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders. Doubtless he had seen
more than one broken gentleman cover poverty with
a brave front of fine lawn and gilded splendour of
array.</p>
<p>&#8220;All one to me, your Royal &#8217;Ighness. Take &#8217;old
&#8217;ere,&#8221; he said facetiously.</p>
<p>We carried the boxes into the hall. When we had
finished I stood mopping my face with a handkerchief,
but my eyes were glued to the label tacked on one of
the boxes.</p>
<p><i>John Armitage, The Oaks, Epsom, Surrey.</i></p>
<p>&#8220;Wot yer waitin&#8217; for?&#8221; asked the fellow sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;The shilling,&#8221; I told him.</p>
<p>I left when he gave it me, and as I reached the
door he bawled to be sure to shut it tight. An idea
jumped to my mind on the instant, and though I
slammed the door I took care to have my foot an inch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
or two within the portal. Next moment I was walking
noisily down the steps and along the pavement.</p>
<p>Three minutes later I tiptoed back up the steps and
tried the door. I opened it slowly and without noise
till I could thrust in my head. The fellow was nowhere
to be seen in the hall. I whipped in, and
closed the door after me. Every board seemed to
creak as I trod gingerly toward the stairway. In the
empty house the least noise echoed greatly. The
polished stairs cried out hollowly my presence. I was
half way up when I came to a full stop. Some one
was coming down round the bend of the stairway.
Softly I slid down the balustrade and crouched behind
the post at the bottom. The man&mdash;it was my friend
of the shilling&mdash;passed within a foot of me, his hand
almost brushing the hair of my head, and crossed the
hall to a room opposite. Again I went up the stairs,
still cautiously, but with a confidence born of the
knowledge of his whereabouts.</p>
<p>The house was large, and I might have wandered
long without guessing where lay the room I wanted
had it not been for a slight sound that came to me&mdash;the
low, soft sobbing of a woman. I groped my way
along the dark passage, turned to the left, and presently
came to the door from behind which issued the
sound. The door was locked on the outside, and the
key was in the lock. I knocked, and at once silence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
fell. To my second knock I got no answer. Then I
turned the key and entered.</p>
<p>A girl was sitting at a table with her back to me,
her averted head leaning wearily on her hand. Dejection
spoke in every line of her figure. She did not
even turn at my entrance, thinking me no doubt to be
her guard. I stood waiting awkwardly, scarce knowing
what to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; I began, &#8220;may I&mdash; Is there&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;
So far I got, then I came to an embarrassed pause, for
I might as well have talked to the dead for all the
answer I got. She did not honour me with the faintest
sign of attention. I hemmed and hawed and
bowed to her back with a growing confusion.</p>
<p>At last she asked over her shoulder in a strained,
even voice,</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it you&#8217;re wanting now? You said I was
to be left by my lane to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>I murmured like a gawk that I was at her service,
and presently as I shifted from one foot to the other
she turned slowly. Her face was a dumb cry for help,
though it was a proud face too&mdash;one not lacking in
fire and courage. I have seen fairer faces, but never
one more to my liking. It was her eyes that held me.
The blue of her own Highland lochs, with all their
changing and indescribably pathetic beauty, lurked
deeply in them. Unconsciously they appealed to me,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
and the world was not wide enough to keep me from
her when they called. Faith, my secret is out already,
and I had resolved that it should keep till near the
end of my story!</p>
<p>I had dropped my muddy cloak before I entered,
and as she looked at me a change came over her.
Despair gave way to a startled surprise. Her eyes
dilated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you, sir? And&mdash;what are you doing
here?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>I think some fear or presage of evil was knocking
at her heart, for though she fronted me very steadily
her eyes were full of alarm. What should a man of
rank be doing in her room on the night she had been
abducted from her lodgings unless his purpose were
evil? She wore a long cloak stretching to the
ground, and from under it slippered feet peeped out.
The cloak was of the latest mode, very wide and open
at the neck and shoulders, and beneath the mantle I
caught more than a glimpse of the laced white
nightrail and the fine sloping neck. &#8217;Twas plain
that her abductors had given her only time to fling
the wrap about her before they snatched her from her
bedchamber. Some wild instinct of defense stirred
within her, and with one hand she clutched the cloak
tightly to her throat. My heart went out to the child
with a great rush of pity. The mad follies of my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
London life slipped from me like the muddy garment
outside, and I swore by all I held most dear not to
see her wronged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; I said, &#8220;for all the world I would not
harm you. I have come to offer you my sword as a
defense against those who would injure you. My
name is Montagu, and I know none of the name that
are liars,&#8221; I cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you the gentleman that was for stopping the
carriage as we came?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am that same unlucky gentleman that was sent
speldering in the glaur.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> I won an entrance to the
house by a trick, and I am here at your service,&#8221; I
said, throwing in my tag of Scotch to reassure
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will be English, but you speak the kindly
Scots,&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother was from the Highlands,&#8221; I told her.</p>
<p>&#8220;What! You have the Highland blood in you?
Oh then, it is the good heart you will have too. Will
you ever have been on the braes of Raasay?&#8221;</p>
<p>I told her no; that I had always lived in England,
though my mother was a Campbell. Her joy was
the least thing in the world daunted, and in her voice
there was a dash of starch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! A Campbell!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></div>
<p>I smiled. &#8217;Twas plain her clan was no friend to
the sons of <i>Diarmaid</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;My father was out in the &#8217;15, and when he wass a
wounded fugitive with the Campbell bloodhounds on
his trail Mary Campbell hid him till the chase was
past. Then she guided him across the mountains
and put him in the way of reaching the Macdonald
country. My father married her after the amnesty,&#8221;
I explained.</p>
<p>The approving light flashed back into her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;At all events then I am not doubting she wass a
good lassie, Campbell or no Campbell; and I am
liking it that your father went back and married her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we are wasting time,&#8221; I urged. &#8220;What can
I do for you? Where do you live? To whom shall
I take you?&#8221;</p>
<p>She fell to earth at once. &#8220;My grief! I do not
know. Malcolm has gone to France. He left me
with Hamish Gorm in lodgings, but they will not be
safe since&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She stopped, and at the memory of
what had happened there the wine crept into her
cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;And who is Malcolm?&#8221; I asked gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;My brother. He iss an agent for King James in
London, and he brought me with him. But he was
called away, and he left me with the gillie. To-night
they broke into my room while Hamish was away,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
weary fa&#8217; the day! And now where shall I
go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My sister is a girl about your age. Cloe would
be delighted to welcome you. I am sure you would
like each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are the good friend to a poor lass that will
never be forgetting, and I will be blithe to burden the
hospitality of your sister till my brother returns.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sharp tread of footsteps on the stairs reached
us. A man was coming up, and he was singing languidly
a love ditty.</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;What is love? &#8217;Tis not hereafter,</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>Something in the voice struck a familiar chord in
my memory, but I could not put a name to its owner.
The girl looked at me with eyes grown suddenly
horror-stricken. I noticed that her face had taken on
the hue of snow.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are too late,&#8221; she cried softly.</p>
<p>We heard a key fumbling in the lock, and then
the door opened&mdash;to let in Volney. His hat was
sweeping to the floor in a bow when he saw me. He
stopped and looked at me in surprise, his lips framing
themselves for a whistle. I could see the starch run
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
through and take a grip of him. For just a gliff he
stood puzzled and angry. Then he came in wearing
his ready dare-devil smile and sat down easily on the
bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hope I&#8217;m not interrupting, Montagu,&#8221; he said
jauntily. &#8220;I dare say though that&#8217;s past hoping for.
You&#8217;ll have to pardon my cursedly malapropos
appearance. Faith, my only excuse is that I did not
know the lady was entertaining other visitors this
evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her with careless insolence out of his
beautiful dark eyes, and for that moment I hated him
with the hate a man will go to hell to satisfy.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will spare this lady your insults,&#8221; I told him
in a low voice. &#8220;At least so far as you can. Your
presence itself is an insult.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Egad, and that&#8217;s where the wind sits, eh? Well,
well, &#8217;tis the manner of the world. When the cat&#8217;s
away!&#8221;</p>
<p>A flame of fire ran through me. I took a step
toward him, hand on sword hilt. With a sweep of
his jewelled hand he waved me back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fie, fie, Kenn! In a lady&#8217;s presence?&#8221;</p>
<p>Volney smiled at the girl in mock gallantry and my
eyes followed his. I never saw a greater change.
She was transformed. Her lithe young figure stood
out tall and strong, every line of weariness gone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
Hate, loathing, scorn, one might read plainly there,
but no trace of fear or despair. She might have been
a lioness defending her young. Her splendour of
dark auburn hair, escaped and fallen free to her waist,
fascinated me with the luxuriance of its disorder.
Volney&#8217;s lazy admiration quickened to a deeper
interest. For an instant his breath came faster. His
face lighted with the joy of the huntsman after worthy
game. But almost immediately he recovered his
aplomb. Turning to me, he asked with his odd light
smile,</p>
<p>&#8220;Staying long, may I ask?&#8221;</p>
<p>My passion was gone. I was possessed by a
slow fire as steady and as enduring as a burning
peat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not quite made up my mind how long to
stay,&#8221; I answered coldly. &#8220;When I leave the lady
goes with me, but I haven&#8217;t decided yet what to do
with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He began to laugh. &#8220;You grow amusing. &#8217;Slife,
you are not all country boor after all! May it please
you, what are the alternatives regarding my humble
self?&#8221; he drawled, leaning back with an elbow on the
pillow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I might kill you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you might. And&mdash;er&mdash; What would I
be doing?&#8221; he asked negligently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Or, since there is a lady present, I might leave
you till another time.&#8221;</p>
<p>His handsome, cynical face, with its curious shifting
lights and shadows, looked up at me for once suffused
with genuine amusement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stap me, you&#8217;d make a fortune as a play actor.
Garrick is a tyro beside you. Some one was telling
me that your financial affairs had been going wrong.
An it comes to the worst, take my advice and out-Garrick
Garrick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are very good. Your interest in my affairs
charms me, Sir Robert. &#8217;Tis true they are not
promising. A friend duped me. He held the
Montagu estates higher than honour.&#8221;</p>
<p>He appeared to reflect. &#8220;Friend? Don&#8217;t think
I&#8217;m acquainted with any of the kind, unless a friend
is one who eats your dinners, drinks your wines,
rides your horses, and&#8221;&mdash;with a swift sidelong look
at the girl&mdash;&#8220;makes love to your charming
adored.&#8221;</p>
<p>Into the girl&#8217;s face the colour flared, but she looked
at him with a contempt so steady that any man but
Volney must have winced.</p>
<p>&#8220;Friendship!&#8221; she cried with infinite disdain.
&#8220;What can such as you know of it? You are false
as Judas. Did you not begowk my honest brother
with fine words till he and I believed you one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
of God&#8217;s noblemen, and when his back was fairly
turned&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had the best excuse in London for my madness,
Aileen,&#8221; he said with the wistful little laugh that had
gone straight to many a woman&#8217;s heart.</p>
<p>Her eye flashed and her bosom heaved. The pure
girl-heart read him like an open book.</p>
<p>&#8220;And are you thinking me so mean a thing as still
to care for your honeyed words? Believe me, there
iss no viper on the braes of Raasay more detestable to
me than you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I looked to see him show anger, but he nursed his
silk-clad ankle with the same insolent languor. He
might have been a priest after the confessional for all
the expression his face wore.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like you angry, Aileen. Faith, &#8217;tis worth being
the object of your rage to see you stamp that pretty
foot and clench those little hands I love to kiss. But
Ecod! Montagu, the hour grows late. The lady
will lose her beauty sleep. Shall you and I go down-stairs
and arrange for a conveyance?&#8221;</p>
<p>He bowed low and kissed his fingers to the girl.
Then he led the way out of the room, fine and
gallant and debonair, a villain every inch of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you be leaving me?&#8221; the girl cried with
parted lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for long,&#8221; I told her. &#8220;Do not fear. I shall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
have you out of here in a jiff,&#8221; and with that I followed
at his heels.</p>
<p>Sir Robert Volney led the way down the corridor
to a small room in the west wing, where flaring, half-burnt
candles guttering in their sconces drove back
the darkness. He leaned against the mantel and
looked long at me out of half-closed eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I ask to what is due the honour of your
presence to-night?&#8221; he drawled at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have said you may ask,&#8221; I fleered rudely. &#8220;But
for me&mdash; Gad&#8217;s life! I am not in the witness
box.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took his snuff mull from his waistcoat pocket
and offered it me, then took a pinch and brushed
from his satin coat imaginary grains with prodigious
care.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are perhaps not aware that I have the right
to ask. It chances that this is my house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed! And the lady we have just left&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;Is, pardon me, none of your concern.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! I&#8217;m not so sure of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith then, you&#8217;ll do well to make sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And&mdash;er&mdash;Mistress Antoinette Westerleigh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite another matter! You&#8217;re out of court
again, Mr. Montagu.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Egad, I enter an exception. The lady we have
just left is of another mind in the affair. She is the
court of last resort, and, I believe, not complaisant to
your suit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She will change her mind,&#8221; he said coolly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust so renowned a gallant as Sir Robert would
not use force.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lard, no! She is a woman and therefore to be
won. But I would advise you to dismiss the lady
from your mind. &#8217;Ware women, Mr. Montagu! You
will sleep easier.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In faith, a curious coincidence! I was about to
tender you the same advice, Sir Robert,&#8221; I told him
lightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will forget the existence of such a lady if you
are wise?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wisdom comes with age. I am for none of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet you will do well to remember your business
and forget mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no business of my own, Sir Robert. Last
night you generously lifted all sordid business cares
from my mind, and now I am quite free to attend
those of my neighbours.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders in the French way.
&#8220;Very well. A wilful man! You&#8217;ve had your
warning, and&mdash; I am not a man to be
thwarted.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I might answer that I am not a man to be
frightened.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll not be the first that has answered that.
The others have &#8216;Hic Jacet&#8217; engraved on their door
plates. Well, it&#8217;s an unsatisfactory world at best, and
Lard! they&#8217;re well quit of it. Still, you&#8217;re young.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And have yet to learn discretion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a pity too,&#8221; he retorted lightly. &#8220;The
door is waiting for you. Better take it, Mr. Montagu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With the lady?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear the lady is tired. Besides, man, think of
her reputation. Zounds! Can she gad about the
city at night alone with so gay a spark as you? &#8217;Tis
a censorious world, and tongues will clack. No, no!
I will save you from any chance of such a scandal,
Mr. Montagu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith, one good turn deserves another. I&#8217;ll stay
here to save your reputation, Sir Robert.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear that mine is fly-blown already and something
the worse for wear. It can take care of itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet I&#8217;ll stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gad&#8217;s life! Stay then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Volney had been standing just within the door, and
at the word he stepped out and flung it to. I sprang
forward, but before I reached it the click sounded. I
was a prisoner, caught like a fly in a spider&#8217;s web, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
much it helped me to beat on the iron-studded door
till my hand bled, to call on him to come in and fight
it out like a man, to storm up and down the room in
a stress of passion.</p>
<p>Presently my rage abated, and I took stock of my
surroundings. The windows were barred with irons
set in stone sockets by masonry. I set my knee
against the window frame and tugged at them till I
was moist with perspiration. As well I might have
pulled at the pillars of St. Paul&#8217;s. I tried my small
sword as a lever, but it snapped in my hand. Again
I examined the bars. There was no way but to pick
them from their sockets by making a groove in the
masonry. With the point of my sword I chipped industriously
at the cement. At the end of ten minutes
I had made perceptible progress. Yet it took me
another hour of labour to accomplish my task. I undid
the blind fastenings, clambered out, and lowered
myself foot by foot to the ground by clinging to the
ivy that grew thick along the wall. The vine gave to
my hand, and the last three yards I took in a rush,
but I picked myself up none the worse save for a torn
face and bruised hands.</p>
<p>The first fall was Volney&#8217;s, and I grudged it him;
but as I took my way to Balmerino&#8217;s lodgings my
heart was far from heavy. The girl was safe for
the present. I knew Volney well enough for that.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
That his plan was to take her to The Oaks and in
seclusion lay a long siege to the heart of the girl, I
could have sworn. But from London to Epsom is a
far cry, and between them much might happen
through chance and fate and&mdash;Kenneth Montagu.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>DEOCH SLAINT AN RIGH!</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re late, Kenn,&#8221; was Balmerino&#8217;s greeting
to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith, my Lord, I&#8217;m earlier than I might
have been. I found it hard to part from a dear friend
who was loathe to let me out of his sight,&#8221; I laughed.</p>
<p>The Scotchman buckled on his sword and disappeared
into the next room. When he returned a pair
of huge cavalry pistols peeped from under his cloak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to the wars, my Lord?&#8221; I quizzed gaily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps. Will you join me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe yes and maybe no. Is the cause good?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The best in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the chances of success?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fortune beckons with both hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm! Has she by any chance a halter in her
hands for Kenn Montagu and an axe for Balmerino
since he is a peer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better the sharp edge of an axe than the dull edge
of hunger for those we love,&#8221; he answered with a
touch of bitterness.</p>
<p>His rooms supplied the sermon to his text. Gaunt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
poverty stared at me on every hand. The floor was
bare and the two ragged chairs were rickety. I knew
now why the white-haired peer was so keen to try a
hazard of new fortunes for the sake of the wife in the
North.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where may you be taking me?&#8221; I asked presently,
as we hurried through Piccadilly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you ask no questions&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;You&#8217;ll tell me no lies. Very good. Odd&#8217;s
my life, I&#8217;m not caring! Any direction is good
enough for me&mdash;unless it leads to Tyburn. But I
warn you that I hold myself unpledged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall remember.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was in the gayest spirits imaginable. The task I
had set myself of thwarting Volney and the present
uncertainty of my position had combined to lend a
new zest to life. I felt the wine of youth bubble in
my veins, and I was ready for whatever fortune had in
store.</p>
<p>Shortly we arrived at one of those streets of unimpeachable
respectability that may be duplicated a hundred
times in London. Its characteristics are monotony
and dull mediocrity; a dead sameness makes all
the houses appear alike. Before one of these we
stopped.</p>
<p>Lord Balmerino knocked, A man came to the
door and thrust out a head suspiciously. There was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
a short whispered colloquy between him and the
Scotch lord, after which he beckoned me to enter.
For an instant I hung back.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you afraid of, man?&#8221; asked Balmerino
roughly.</p>
<p>I answered to the spur and pressed forward at once.
He led the way along a dark passage and down a
flight of stone steps into a cellar fitted up as a drinking
room. There was another low-toned consultation
before we were admitted. I surmised that Balmerino
stood sponsor for me, and though I was a little
disturbed at my equivocal position, yet I was strangely
glad to be where I was. For here was a promise of
adventure to stimulate a jaded appetite. I assured
myself that at least I should not suffer dulness.</p>
<p>There were in the room a scant dozen of men, and
as I ran them over with my eye the best I could say
for their quality in life was that they had not troubled
the tailor of late. Most of them were threadbare at
elbow and would have looked the better of a good
dinner. There were two or three exceptions, but for
the most part these broken gentlemen bore the marks
of recklessness and dissipation. Two I knew: the
O&#8217;Sullivan that had assisted at the plucking of a certain
pigeon on the previous night, and Mr. James Brown,
alias Mac-something or other, of the supple sword and
the Highland slogan.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>Along with another Irishman named Anthony
Creagh the fellow O&#8217;Sullivan rushed up to my Lord, eyes
snapping with excitement. He gave me a nod and a
&#8220;How d&#8217;ye do, Montagu? Didn&#8217;t know you were
of the honest party,&#8221; then broke out with&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Great news, Balmerino! The French fleet has
sailed with transports for fifteen thousand men. I
have advices direct from the Prince. Marshal Saxe
commands, and the Prince himself is with them. London
will be ours within the week. Sure the good day
is coming at last. The King&mdash;God bless him!&mdash;will
have his own again; and a certain Dutch beer tub that
we know of will go scuttling back to his beloved Hanover,
glory be the day!&#8221;</p>
<p>Balmerino&#8217;s eyes flashed.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have sailed then at last. I have been expecting
it a week. If they once reach the Thames
there is no force in England that can stop them,&#8221; he
said quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely the small fleet of Norris will prove no barrier?&#8221;
asked another dubiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poof! They weel eat heem up jus&#8217; like one leetle
mouse, my frien&#8217;,&#8221; boasted a rat-faced Frenchman
with a snap of his fingers. &#8220;Haf they not two sheeps
to his one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Egad, I hope they don&#8217;t eat the mutton then and
let Norris go,&#8221; laughed Creagh. He was a devil-may-care
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
Irishman, brimful of the virtues and the vices of
his race.</p>
<p>I had stumbled into a hornet&#8217;s nest with a vengeance.
They were mad as March hares, most of them.
For five minutes I sat amazed, listening to the wildest
talk it had ever been my lot to hear. The Guelphs
would be driven out. The good old days would be
restored; there would be no more whiggery and
Walpolism; with much more of the same kind of talk.
There was drinking of wine and pledging of toasts to
the King across the water, and all the while I sat by
the side of Balmerino with a face like whey. For I
was simmering with anger. I foresaw the moment
when discovery was inevitable, and in those few minutes
while I hung back in the shadow and wished myself
a thousand miles away hard things were thought
of Arthur Elphinstone Lord Balmerino. He had
hoped to fling me out of my depths and sweep me
away with the current, but I resolved to show him
another ending to it.</p>
<p>Presently Mr. James Brown came up and offered me
a frank hand of welcome. Balmerino introduced him
as Captain Donald Roy Macdonald. I let my countenance
express surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely you are mistaken, my Lord. This gentleman
and I have met before, and I think his name is
Brown.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>Macdonald laughed a little sheepishly. &#8220;The air
of London is not just exactly healthy for Highland
Jacobite gentlemen at present. I wouldna wonder
but one might catch the scarlet fever gin he werena
carefu&#8217;, so I just took a change of names for a bit
while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did not disguise the Highland slogan you
flung out last night,&#8221; I laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I cry it?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;It would be just from
habit then. I didna ken that I opened my mouth.&#8221;
Then he turned to my affairs. &#8220;And I suppose you
will be for striking a blow for the cause like the rest
of us. Well then, the sooner the better. I am fair
wearying for a certain day that is near at hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>With which he began to hum &#8220;The King shall
have his own again.&#8221;</p>
<p>I flushed, and boggled at the &#8220;No!&#8221; that stuck in
my throat. Creagh, standing near, slewed round his
head at the word.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, what&#8217;s that? Say that again, Montagu!&#8221;</p>
<p>I took the bull by the horns and answered bluntly,
&#8220;There has been a mistake made. George is a good
enough king for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>I saw Macdonald stiffen, and angry amazement leap
to the eyes of the two Irishmen.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Sblood! What the devil! Why are you here
then?&#8221; cried Creagh.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>His words, and the excitement in his raised voice,
rang the bell for a hush over the noisy room. Men
dropped their talk and turned to us. A score of fierce
suspicious eyes burnt into me. My heart thumped
against my ribs like a thing alive, but I answered&mdash;steadily
and quietly enough, I dare say&mdash;&#8220;You will
have to ask Lord Balmerino that. I did not know
where he was bringing me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Damnation!&#8221; cried one Leath. &#8220;What cock
and bull tale is this? Not know where he was bringing
you! &#8217;Slife, I do not like it!&#8221;</p>
<p>I sat on the table negligently dangling one foot in
air. For that matter I didn&#8217;t like it myself, but I was
not going to tell him so. Brushing a speck of mud
from my coat I answered carelessly,</p>
<p>&#8220;Like it or mislike it, devil a bit I care!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha, ha! I theenk you will find a leetle reason for
caring,&#8221; said the Frenchman ominously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stab me, if I understand,&#8221; cried Creagh. &#8220;Balmerino
did not kidnap you here, did he? Devil take
me if it&#8217;s at all clear to me!&#8221;</p>
<p>O&#8217;Sullivan pushed to the front with an evil laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;T is clear enough to me,&#8221; he said bluntly. &#8220;It&#8217;s
the old story of one too many trusted. He hears our
plans and then the smug-faced villain peaches. Next
week he sees us all scragged at Tyburn. But he&#8217;s
made a little mistake this time, sink me! He won&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
live to see the Chevalier O&#8217;Sullivan walk off the cart.
If you&#8217;ll give me leave, I&#8217;ll put a name to the gentleman.
He&#8217;s what they call a spy, and stap my vitals!
he doesn&#8217;t leave this room alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>At his words a fierce cry leaped from tense throats.
A circle of white furious faces girdled me about.
Rapiers hung balanced at my throat and death looked
itchingly at me from many an eye.</p>
<p>As for me, I lazed against the table with a strange
odd contraction of the heart, a sudden standing still
and then a fierce pounding of the blood. Yet I was
quite master of myself. Indeed I smiled at them,
carelessly, as one that deprecated so much ado about
nothing. And while I smiled, the wonder was passing
through my mind whether the smile would still
be there after they had carved the life out of me. I
looked death in the face, and I found myself copying
unconsciously the smirking manners of the Macaronis.
Faith, &#8217;t was a leaf from Volney&#8217;s life I was rehearsing
for them.</p>
<p>This but while one might blink an eye, then Lord
Balmerino interrupted. &#8220;God&#8217;s my life! Here&#8217;s a
feery-farry about nothing. Put up your toasting fork,
De Vallery! The lad will not bite.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Warranted to be of gentle manners,&#8221; I murmured,
brushing again at the Mechlin lace of my coat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen are requested not to tease the animals,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
laughed Creagh. He was as full of heat as a pepper
castor, but he had the redeeming humour of his race.</p>
<p>Macdonald beat down the swords. &#8220;Are you a&#8217;
daft, gentlemen? The lad came with Balmerino.
He is no spy. Put up, put up, Chevalier! Don&#8217;t
glower at me like that, man! Hap-weel rap-weel, the
lad shall have his chance to explain. I will see no
man&#8217;s cattle hurried.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Peste! Let him explain then, and not summer
and winter over the story,&#8221; retorted O&#8217;Sullivan sourly.</p>
<p>Lord Balmerino slipped an arm through mine.
&#8220;If you are quite through with your play acting, gentlemen,
we will back to reason and common sense
again. Mr. Montagu may not be precisely a pronounced
Jack, but then he doesn&#8217;t give a pinch of
snuff for the Whigs either. I think we shall find him
open to argument.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d better be&mdash;if he knows what&#8217;s good for
him,&#8221; growled O&#8217;Sullivan.</p>
<p>At once I grew obstinate. &#8220;I do not take my
politics under compulsion, Mr. O&#8217;Sullivan,&#8221; I flung
out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you shouldn&#8217;t have come here. You&#8217;ve
drawn the wine, and by God! you shall drink it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I? We&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, Kenn! I promise you there shall be no
compulsion,&#8221; cried the old Lord. Then to O&#8217;Sullivan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
in a stern whisper, &#8220;Let be, you blundering Irish
man! You&#8217;re setting him against us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Balmerino was right. Every moment I grew colder
and stiffer. If they wanted me for a recruit they
were going about it the wrong way. I would not be
frightened into joining them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like the rest of us y&#8217; are a ruined man. Come,
better your fortune. Duty and pleasure jump together.
James Montagu&#8217;s son is not afraid to take a
chance,&#8221; urged the Scotch Lord.</p>
<p>Donald Roy&#8217;s eyes had fastened on me from the
first like the grip-of steel. He had neither moved
nor spoken, but I knew that he was weighing me in
the balance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you will not be exactly in love with the
wamey Dutchmen, Mr. Montagu?&#8221; he asked now.</p>
<p>I smiled. &#8220;If you put it that way I don&#8217;t care one
jack straw for the whole clamjamfry of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking so. They are a different race from
the Stuarts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are indeed,&#8221; I acquiesced dryly. Then
the devil of mischief stirred in me to plague him.
&#8220;There&#8217;s all the difference of bad and a vast deal
worse between them. It&#8217;s a matter of comparisons,&#8221;
I concluded easily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are pleased to be facetious,&#8221; returned O&#8217;Sullivan
sourly. &#8220;But I would ask you to remember
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
that you are not yet out of the woods, Mr. Montagu.
My Lord seems satisfied, but here are some more of
us waiting a plain answer to this riddle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what may the riddle be?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just this. What are you doing here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith, that&#8217;s easy answered,&#8221; I told him jauntily.
&#8220;I&#8217;m here by invitation of Lord Balmerino, and it
seems I&#8217;m not overwelcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elphinstone interrupted impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, we&#8217;re at cross purposes. You&#8217;re
trying to drive Mr. Montagu, and I&#8217;m all for leading
him. I warn you he&#8217;s not to be driven. Let us
talk it over reasonably.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; returned O&#8217;Sullivan sulkily. &#8220;Talk as
long as you please, but he doesn&#8217;t get out of this
room till I&#8217;m satisfied.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are engaged on a glorious enterprise to restore
to these islands their ancient line of sovereigns.
You say you do not care for the Hanoverians. Why
not then strike a blow for the right cause?&#8221; asked
Leath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right and wrong are not to be divided by so
clean a cut,&#8221; I told him. &#8220;I am no believer in the
divine inheritance of kings. In the last analysis the
people shall be the judge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course; and we are going to put it to the
test.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You want to set the clock back sixty years. It
will not do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We think it will. We are resolved at least to
try,&#8221; said Balmerino.</p>
<p>I shrugged my shoulders. &#8220;The times are against
you. The Stuarts have dropped out of the race.
The mill cannot grind with the water that is
past.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if the water be not past?&#8221; asked Leath
fiercely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mar found it so in the &#8217;15, and many honest gentlemen
paid for his mistake with their heads. My
father&#8217;s brother for one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mar bungled it from start to finish. He had the
game in his own hands and dribbled away his chances
like a coward and a fool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps, but even so, much water has passed under
London Bridge since then. It is sixty years since
the Stuarts were driven out. Two generations have
slept on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the third generation of sleepers shall be
wakened. The stream is coming down in spate,&#8221;
said Balmerino.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear you say it,&#8221; I answered dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you shall live to see us do it, Mr. Montagu.
The heather&#8217;s in a blaze already. The fiery cross
will be speeding from Badenoch to the Braes of Balwhidder.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
The clans will all rise whatever,&#8221; cried
Donald Roy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure about Mr. Montagu living to
see it. My friends O&#8217;Sullivan and De Vallery seem
to think not,&#8221; said Creagh, giving me his odd smile.
&#8220;Now, I&#8217;ll wager a crown that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whose crown did you say?&#8221; I asked politely,
handing him back his smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government cannot stand out against us,&#8221;
argued Balmerino. &#8220;The Duke of Newcastle is almost
an imbecile. The Dutch usurper himself is over
in Hanover courting a new mistress. His troops are
all engaged in foreign war. There are not ten thousand
soldiers on the island. At this very moment the
King of France is sending fifteen thousand across in
transports. He will have no difficulty in landing them
and London cannot hold out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith, he might get his army here. I&#8217;m not
denying that. But I&#8217;ll promise him trouble in getting
it away again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Highlands are ready to fling away the scabbard
for King James III,&#8221; said Donald Roy simply.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is in my mind that you have done that more
than once before and that because of it misguided
heads louped from sturdy shoulders,&#8221; I answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wales too is full of loyal gentlemen. What can
the Hanoverians do if they march across the border
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
to join the Highlanders rolling down from the North
and Marshal Saxe with his French army?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My imagination halts,&#8221; I answered dryly. &#8220;You
will be telling me next that England is wearying for a
change back to the race of Kings she has twice driven
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do say it,&#8221; cried Leath. &#8220;Bolingbroke is
already negotiating with the royal family. Newcastle
is a broken reed. Hervey will not stand out. Walpole
is a dying man. In whom can the Dutchman
trust? The nation is tired of them, their mistresses
and their German brood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When we had them we found these same Stuarts
a dangerous and troublesome race. We could not in
any manner get along with them. We drove them
out, and then nothing would satisfy us but we must
have them back again. Well, they had their second
chance, and we found them worse than before. They
had not learnt the lesson of the age. They&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Split me, y&#8217;are not here to lecture us, Mr. Montagu,&#8221;
cried Leath with angry eye. &#8220;Damme, we
don&#8217;t care a rap for your opinions, but you have heard
too much. To be short, the question is, will you join
us or won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be short then, Mr. Leath, not on compulsion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no compulsion about it, Kenn. If you
join it is of your own free will,&#8221; said Balmerino.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think not. Mr. Montagu has no option in the
matter,&#8221; cried O&#8217;Sullivan. &#8220;He forfeited his right to decide
for himself when he blundered in and heard our
plans. Willy nilly, he must join us!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if I don&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>
<p>His smile was like curdled milk. &#8220;Have you made
your will, Mr. Montagu?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I made it at the gaming table last night, and the
Chevalier O&#8217;Sullivan was one of the legatees,&#8221; I answered
like a flash.</p>
<p>&#8220;Touché, Sully,&#8221; laughed Creagh. &#8220;Ecod, I like
our young cockerel&#8217;s spirit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I don&#8217;t,&#8221; returned O&#8217;Sullivan. &#8220;He shall join
us, or damme&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He stopped, but his meaning
was plain to be read.</p>
<p>I answered dourly. &#8220;You may blow the coals, but
I will not be het.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith, you&#8217;re full of epigrams to-night, Mr. Montagu,&#8221;
Anthony Creagh was good enough to say.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll make a fine stage exit&mdash;granting that Sully
has his way. I wouldn&#8217;t miss it for a good
deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If the house is crowded you may have my seat
for nothing,&#8221; was my reply. Strange to say my spirits
were rising. This was the first perilous adventure
of my life, and my heart sang. Besides, I had confidence
enough in Balmerino to know that he would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
never stand aside and let me suffer for his indiscretion
if he could help it.</p>
<p>The old Lord&#8217;s troubled eyes looked into mine. I
think he was beginning to regret this impulsive experiment
of his. He tried a new tack with me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course there is a risk. We may not win. Perhaps
you do well to think of the consequences. As
you say, heads may fall because of the rising.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dye flooded my cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might have spared me that, my Lord. I am
thinking of the blood of innocent people that must be
spilled.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your joining us will neither help nor hinder
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And your not joining us will have deucedly unpleasant
effects for you,&#8221; suggested O&#8217;Sullivan pleasantly.</p>
<p>Lord Balmerino flung round on him angrily, his
hand on sword hilt. &#8220;I think you have forgotten
one thing, Mr. O&#8217;Sullivan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that is&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That Mr. Montagu came here as my guest. If he
does not care to join us he shall be free as air to depart.&#8221;</p>
<p>O&#8217;Sullivan laughed hardily. &#8220;Shall he? Gadzooks!
The Chevalier O&#8217;Sullivan will have a word to say with
him first. He did not come as any guest of mine.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
What the devil! If you were not sure of him, why
did you bring him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Balmerino fumed, but he had no answer for that.
He could only say,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought him sure to join, but I can answer for
his silence with my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;T will be more to the point that we do not answer
for his speech with our lives,&#8221; grumbled
Leath.</p>
<p>The Frenchman leaned forward eagerly. &#8220;You
thought heem to be at heart of us, and you were
meestaken; you theenk heem sure to keep our secret,
but how are we to know you are not again meestaken?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, that&#8217;s easy,&#8221; broke out O&#8217;Sullivan scornfully.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll know when the rope is round our gullets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he won&#8217;t peach, Sully. He isn&#8217;t that kind.
Stap me, you never know a gentleman when you see
one,&#8221; put in Creagh carelessly.</p>
<p>The young Highlander Macdonald spoke up.
&#8220;Gentlemen, I&#8217;m all for making an end to this collieshangie.
By your leave, Lord Balmerino, Mr. Creagh
and myself will step up-stairs with this gentleman and
come to some composition on the matter. Mr.
Montagu saved my life last night, but I give you the
word of Donald Roy Macdonald that if I am not
satisfied in the end I will plant six inches of steel in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
his wame for him to digest, and there&#8217;s gumption for
you at all events.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said it as composedly as if he had been proposing
a stroll down the Row with me, and I knew him
to be just the man who would keep his word. The
others knew it too, and presently we four found ourselves
alone together in a room above.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your mind so set against joining us, Kenn? I
have got myself into a pickle, and I wish you would
just get me out,&#8221; Balmerino began.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they had asked me civilly I dare say I should
have said &#8216;Yes!&#8217; an hour ago, but I&#8217;ll not be forced
in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite right, too. You&#8217;re a broth of a boy. I
wouldn&#8217;t in your place, Montagu, and I take off my
hat to your spirit,&#8221; said Creagh. &#8220;Now let&#8217;s begin
again.&#8221;&mdash;He went to the door and threw it open.&mdash;&#8220;The
way is clear for you to leave if you want to go,
but I would be most happy to have you stay with us.
It&#8217;s men like you we&#8217;re looking for, and&mdash; Won&#8217;t
you strike a blow for the King o&#8217;er the sea, Montagu?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is of the line of our ancient monarchs. He
and his race have ruled us a thousand years,&#8221; urged
Balmerino. &#8220;They have had their faults perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; I smiled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, and if they have,&#8221; cried Donald Roy hotly
in the impetuous Highland way. &#8220;Is this a time to
be remembering them? For my part, I will be forgetting
their past faults and minding only their
present distresses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It appears as easy for a Highlander to forget the
faults of the Stuarts as it is for them to forget his
services,&#8221; I told him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you harp on their faults. Have you none of
your own?&#8221; cried Elphinstone impatiently. &#8220;I have
seen and talked with the young Prince. He is one to follow
to the death. I have never met the marrow of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think of the thousands who will lose their lives
for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, and that&#8217;s a driech subject, too, but Donald
Roy would a hantle rather die with claymore in hand
and the whiddering steel aboot his head than be always
fearing to pay the piper,&#8221; said the young Highlander
blithely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father was out for the King in the &#8217;15,&#8221; said
Balmerino gently.</p>
<p>Oh, Arthur Elphinstone had the guile for all his
rough ways. I was moved more than I cared to own.
Many a time I had sat at my father&#8217;s knee and
listened to the tale of &#8220;the &#8217;15.&#8221; The Highland blood
in me raced the quicker through my veins. All the
music of the heather hills and the wimpling burns
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
wooed me to join my kinsmen in the North. My
father&#8217;s example, his brother&#8217;s blood, loyalty to the
traditions of my family, my empty purse, the friendship
of Balmerino and Captain Macdonald, all tugged
at my will; but none of them were so potent as the
light that shone in the eyes of a Highland lassie I had
never met till one short hour before. I tossed aside
all my scruples and took the leap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come!&#8221; I cried. &#8220;Lend yourselves to me on a
mission of some danger for one night and I will
pledge myself a partner in your enterprise. I can
promise you that the help I ask of you may be
honourably given. A fair exchange is no robbery.
What say you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gad&#8217;s life, I cry agreed. You&#8217;re cheap at the
price, Mr. Montagu. I&#8217;m yours, Rip me, if you
want me to help rum-pad a bishop&#8217;s coach,&#8221; exclaimed
the Irishman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Creagh has just taken the words out of my
mouth,&#8221; cried Donald Roy. &#8220;If you&#8217;re wanting to
lift a lassie or to carry the war to a foe I&#8217;ll be blithe
to stand at your back. You may trust Red Donald
for that whatever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You put your finger on my ambitions, Captain
Macdonald. I&#8217;m wanting to do just those two things.
You come to scratch so readily that I hope you have
had some practice of your own,&#8221; I laughed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>There was wine on the table and I filled the glasses.</p>
<p>&#8220;If no other sword leaves scabbard mine shall,&#8221; I
cried in a flame of new-born enthusiasm. &#8220;Gentlemen,
I give you the King over the water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;King James! God bless him,&#8221; echoed Balmerino
and Creagh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Deoch slaint an Righ! (The King&#8217;s Drink). And
win or lose, we shall have a beautiful time of it whatever,&#8221;
cried Donald gaily.</p>
<p>An hour later Kenneth Montagu, Jacobite, walked
home arm in arm with Anthony Creagh and Donald
Roy Macdonald. He was setting forth to them a tale
of an imprisoned maid and a plan for the rescue of
that same lady.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>OF LOVE AND WAR</h3>
</div>

<p>All day the rain had splashed down with an
unusual persistence, but now there was a rising
wind and a dash of clear sky over to the
south which promised fairer weather. I was blithe to
see it, for we had our night&#8217;s work cut out for us and
a driving storm would not add to our comfort.</p>
<p>From my hat, from the elbows of my riding-coat,
and from my boot-heels constant rivulets ran; but I
took pains to keep the pistols under my doublet dry
as toast. At the courtyard of the inn I flung myself
from my horse and strode to the taproom where my
companions awaited me. In truth they were making
the best of their circumstances. A hot water jug
steamed in front of the hearth where Creagh lolled in
a big armchair. At the table Captain Macdonald
was compounding a brew by the aid of lemons, spices,
and brandy. They looked the picture of content, and
I stood streaming in the doorway a moment to admire
the scene.</p>
<p>&#8220;What luck, Montagu?&#8221; asked Creagh.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re at &#8216;The Jolly Soldier&#8217; all right <i>en route</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
for Epsom,&#8221; I told him. &#8220;Arrived a half hour before
I left. Hamish Gorm is hanging about there to let us
know when they start. Volney has given orders for a
fresh relay of horses, so they are to continue their
journey to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the lady?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The child looks like an angel of grief. She is
quite out of hope. Faith, her despair took me by the
heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My certes! I dare swear it,&#8221; returned Donald
Roy dryly. &#8220;And did you make yourself known to
her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, she went straight to her room. Volney has
given it out that the lady is his wife and is demented.
His man Watkins spreads the report broadcast to
forestall any appeal she may make for help. I talked
with the valet in the stables. He had much to say
about how dearly his master and his mistress loved
each other, and what a pity &#8217;twas that the lady has
lately fallen out of her mind by reason of illness.
&#8217;Twas the one thing that spoilt the life of Mr. Armitage,
who fairly dotes on his sweet lady. Lud, yes!
And one of her worst delusions is that he is not really
her husband and that he wishes to harm her. Oh,
they have contrived well their precious story to avoid
outside interference.&#8221;</p>
<p>I found more than one cause to doubt the fortunate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
issue of the enterprise upon which we were engaged.
Volney might take the other road; or he might postpone
his journey on account of the foul weather. Still
other contingencies rose to my mind, but Donald Roy
and Creagh made light of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Havers! If he is the man you have drawn for
me he will never be letting a smirr of rain interfere
with his plans; and as for the other road, it will be a
river in spate by this time,&#8221; the Highlander reassured
me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, I&#8217;ll give you four to one in ponies the
thing does not miscarry,&#8221; cried Creagh in his rollicking
way. &#8220;After the King comes home I&#8217;ll dance at
your wedding, me boy; and here&#8217;s to Mrs. Montagu
that is to be, bedad!&#8221;</p>
<p>My wildest dreams had never carried me so far as
this yet, and I flushed to my wig at his words; but
the wild Irishman only laughed at my remonstrance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith man, &#8217;tis you or I! &#8217;Twould never do for
three jolly blades like us to steal the lady from her
lover and not offer another in exchange. No, no!
Castle Creagh is crying for a mistress, and if you
don&#8217;t spunk up to the lady Tony Creagh will.&#8221;</p>
<p>To his humour of daffing I succumbed, and fell into
an extraordinary ease with the world. Here I sat in a
snug little tavern with the two most taking comrades
in the world drinking a hot punch brewed to a nicety,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
while outside the devil of a storm roared and
screamed.</p>
<p>As for my companions, they were old campaigners,
not to be ruffled by the slings of envious fortune.
Captain Donald Roy was wont to bear with composure
good luck and ill, content to sit him down
whistling on the sodden heath to eat his mouthful of
sour brose with the same good humour he would have
displayed at a gathering of his clan gentlemen where
the table groaned with usquebaugh, mountain trout,
and Highland venison. Creagh&#8217;s philosophy too was
all for taking what the gods sent and leaving uncrossed
bridges till the morrow. Was the weather
foul? Sure, the sun would soon shine, and what was
a cloak for but to keep out the rain? I never knew
him lose his light gay spirits, and I have seen him at
many an evil pass.</p>
<p>The clatter of a horse&#8217;s hoofs in the courtyard put a
period to our festivities. Presently rug-headed Hamish
Gorm entered, a splash of mud from brogues to
bonnet.</p>
<p>&#8220;What news, Hamish? Has Volney started?&#8221; I
cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;She would be leaving directly. Ta Sassenach iss
in ta carriage with ta daughter of Macleod, and he
will be a fery goot man to stick a dirk in whatefer,&#8221;
fumed the gillie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>I caught him roughly by the shoulder. &#8220;There
will be no dirk play this night, Hamish Gorm. Do
you hear that? It will be left for your betters to
settle with this man, and if you cannot remember that
you will just stay here.&#8221;</p>
<p>He muttered sullenly that he would remember, but
it was a great pity if Hamish Gorm could not avenge
the wrongs of the daughter of his chief.</p>
<p>We rode for some miles along a cross country path
where the mud was so deep that the horses sank to
their fetlocks. The wind had driven away the rain
and the night had cleared overhead. There were still
scudding clouds scouring across the face of the moon,
but the promise was for a clear night. We reached
the Surrey road and followed it along the heath till we
came to the shadow of three great oaks. Many a
Dick Turpin of the road had lurked under the drooping
boughs of these same trees and sallied out to the
hilltop with his ominous cry of &#8220;Stand and deliver!&#8221;
Many a jolly grazier and fat squire had yielded up his
purse at this turn of the road. For a change we
meant to rum-pad a baronet, and I flatter myself we
made as dashing a trio of cullies as any gentlemen of
the heath among them all.</p>
<p>It might have been a half hour after we had taken
our stand that the rumbling of a coach came to our
ears. The horses were splashing through the mud,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
plainly making no great speed. Long before we saw
the chaise, the cries of the postilions urging on the
horses were to be heard. After an interminable
period the carriage swung round the turn of the road
and began to take the rise. We caught the postilion
at disadvantage as he was flogging the weary animals
up the brow of the hill. He looked up and caught
sight of us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of the way, fellows,&#8221; he cried testily. Next instant
he slipped to the ground and disappeared in the
darkness, crying &#8220;&#8217;Ware highwaymen!&#8221; In the shine
of the coach lamps he had seen Creagh&#8217;s mask and
pistol. The valet Watkins, sitting on the box, tried
to lash up the leaders, but Macdonald blocked the way
with his horse, what time the Irishman and I gave our
attention to the occupants of the chaise.</p>
<p>At the first cry of the postilion a bewigged powdered
head had been thrust from the window and immediately
withdrawn. Now I dismounted and went
forward to open the door. From the corner of
the coach into which Aileen Macleod had withdrawn
a pair of bright eager eyes looked into
my face, but no Volney was to be seen. The open
door opposite explained his disappearance. I raised
the mask a moment from my face, and the girl gave a
cry of joy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you think I had deserted you?&#8221; I asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I did not know. I wass thinking that
perhaps he had killed you. I will be thanking
God that you are alive,&#8221; she cried, with a sweet little
lift and tremble to her voice that told me tears were
near.</p>
<p>A shot rang out, and then another.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me for a moment. I had forgot the gentleman,&#8221;
I said, hastily withdrawing my head.</p>
<p>As I ran round the back of the coach I came
plump into Volney. Though dressed to make love
and not war, I&#8217;ll do him the justice to say that one
was as welcome to him as the other. He was shining
in silver satin and blue silk and gold lace, but in each
hand he carried a great horse pistol, one of which was
still smoking at the barrel. The other he pointed at
me, but with my sword I thrust up the point and it
went off harmlessly in the air. Then I flung him
from me and covered him with my barker. Creagh
also was there to emphasize the wisdom of discretion.
Sir Robert Volney was as daring a man as ever lived,
but he was no fool neither. He looked at my weapon
shining on him in the moonlight and quietly conceded
to himself that the game was against him for the
moment. From his fingers he slipped the rings, and
the watch from his pocket-coat. To carry out our
pretension I took them and filled my pockets with his
jewelry.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A black night, my cullies,&#8221; said Volney as easy as
you please.</p>
<p>&#8220;The colour of your business,&#8221; I retorted thoughtlessly.</p>
<p>He started, looking at me very sharp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Else you would not be travelling on such a night,&#8221;
I explained lamely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! I think we will not discuss my business. As
it happens, the lady has no jewelry with her. If you
are quite through with us, my good fellows, we&#8217;ll wish
you a pleasant evening. Watkins, where&#8217;s that d&mdash;d
postilion?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Softly, Sir Robert! The night&#8217;s young yet. Will
you not spare us fifteen minutes while the horses rest?&#8221;
proposed Creagh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, if you put it that way,&#8221; he answered negligently,
his agile mind busy with the problem before
him. I think he began to put two and two together.
My words might have been a chance shot, but when
on the heel of them Creagh let slip his name Volney
did not need to be told that we were not regular fly-by-nights.
His eyes and his ears were intent to pierce
our disguises.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith, my bullies, you deserve success if you
operate on such nights as this. An honest living
were easier come by, but Lard! not so enticing by a
deal. Your enterprise is worthy of commendation,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
and I would wager a pony against a pinch of snuff
that some day you&#8217;ll be raised to a high position by
reason of it. How is it the old catch runs?</p>

<p>&#8220;If I have to get up in the milkman hours, begad, when
that day comes I&#8217;ll make it a point to be at Tyburn
to see your promotion over the heads of humdrum
honest folks,&#8221; he drawled, and at the tail of his speech
yawned in our faces.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll send you cards to the entertainment when
that happy day arrives,&#8221; laughed Creagh, delighted of
course at the aplomb of the Macaroni.</p>
<p>Donald Roy came up to ask what should be done
with Watkins. It appeared that Volney had mistaken
him for one of us and let fly at him. The fellow
lay groaning on the ground as if he were on the
edge of expiration. I stooped and examined him.
&#8217;Twas a mere flesh scratch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing the matter but a punctured wing. All
he needs is a kerchief round his arm,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>Captain Macdonald looked disgusted and a little
relieved.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Fore God, he deaved (deafened) me with his
yammering till I thought him about to ship for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
other world. These Englishers make a geyan work
about nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the moment remembrance of Volney had
slipped from our minds. As I rose to my feet he
stepped forward. Out flashed his sword and ripped
the mask from my face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Egad, I thought so,&#8221; he chuckled. &#8220;My young
friend Montagu repairing his fallen fortunes on the
road! Won&#8217;t you introduce me to the other gentlemen,
or would they rather remain incog? Captain
Claude Duval, your most obedient! Sir Dick Turpin,
yours to command! Delighted, &#8217;pon my word, to be
rum-padded by such distinguished&mdash;er&mdash;knights of
the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The honour is ours,&#8221; answered Creagh gravely, returning
his bow, but the Irishman&#8217;s devil-may-care
eyes were dancing.</p>
<p>&#8220;A strange fortuity, in faith, that our paths have
crossed so often of late, Montagu. Now I would lay
something good that our life lines will not cross more
than once more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should we meet at all again?&#8221; I cried.
&#8220;Here is a piece of good turf under the moonlight.
&#8217;Twere a pity to lose it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He appeared to consider. &#8220;As you say, the turf is
all that is to be desired and the light will suffice.
Why not? We get in each other&#8217;s way confoundedly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
and out of doubt will some day have to settle our little
difference. Well then, if &#8217;twere done &#8217;twere well
done quickly. Faith, Mr. Montagu, y&#8217;are a man
after my own heart, and it gives me a vast deal of
pleasure to accept your proposal. Consider me your
most obedient to command and prodigiously at your
service.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raffish and flamboyant, he lounged forward to the
window of the carriage.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg a thousand pardons, sweet, for leaving you
a few minutes alone,&#8221; he said with his most silken
irony. &#8220;I am desolated at the necessity, but this
gentleman has a claim that cannot be ignored. Believe
me, I shall make the absence very short. Dear
my life, every instant that I am from you is snatched
from Paradise. Fain would I be with you alway, but
stern duty&#8221;&mdash;the villain stopped to draw a plaintive
and theatric sigh&mdash;&#8220;calls me to attend once for all
to a matter of small moment. Anon I shall be with
you, life of my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him as if he were the dirt beneath
her feet, and still he smiled his winsome smile, carrying
on the mock pretense that she was devoted to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, sweet my heart!&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;&#8217;Twere
cheap to die for such a loving look from thee. All
Heaven lies in it. &#8217;Tis better far to live for many
more of such.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>There was a rush of feet and a flash of steel. Donald
Roy leaped forward just in time, and next moment
Hamish Gorm lay stretched on the turf, muttering
Gaelic oaths and tearing at the sod with his dirk in
an impotent rage. Sir Robert looked down at the
prostrate man with his inscrutable smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your friend from the Highlands is in a vast
hurry, Montagu. He can&#8217;t even wait till you have
had your chance to carve me. Well, are you ready
to begin the argument?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite at your command. There is a bit of firm
turf beyond the oaks. If you will lead the way I
shall be with you anon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lud! I had forgot. You have your adieux to
make to the lady. Pray do not let me hurry you,&#8221;
he said urbanely, as he picked his way daintily
through the mud.</p>
<p>When he had gone I turned to the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall be quit of him,&#8221; I told her. &#8220;You may
rely on my friends if&mdash;if the worst happens. They
will take you to Montagu Grange, and my brother
Charles will push on with you to Scotland. In this
country you would not be safe from him while he
lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face was like the snow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Iss there no other way whatever?&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;Must you be fighting with this man for me, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
you only a boy? Oh, I could be wishing for my
brother Malcolm or some of the good claymores on
the braes of Raasay!&#8221;</p>
<p>The vanity in me was stung by her words.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not such a boy neither, and Angelo judged
me a good pupil. You might find a worse
champion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it iss the good friend you are to me, and I
am loving you for it, but I think of what may happen
to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>My pulse leaped and my eyes burned, but I answered
lightly,</p>
<p>&#8220;For a change think of what may happen to him,
and maybe to pass the time you might put up a bit
prayer for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Believe me, I will be doing that same,&#8221; she cried
with shining eyes, and before I divined her intent had
stooped to kiss my hand that rested on the coach
door.</p>
<p>My heart lilted as I crossed the heath to where the
others were waiting for me beyond the dip of the
hillock.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith, I began to think you had forgotten me and
gone off with the lady yourself,&#8221; laughed Volney.</p>
<p>I flung off my cloak and my inner coat, for though
the night was chill I knew I should be warm enough
when once we got to work. Then, strangely enough,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
an unaccountable reluctance to engage came over me,
and I stood tracing figures on the heath with the point
of my small sword.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you ready?&#8221; asked the baronet.</p>
<p>I broke out impetuously. &#8220;Sir Robert, you have
ruined many. Your victims are to be counted by the
score. I myself am one. But this girl shall not be
added to the list. I have sworn it; so have my friends.
There is still time for you to leave unhurt if you desire
it, but if we once cross swords one of us must die.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And, prithee, Mr. Montagu, why came we here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet even now if you will desist&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>His caustic insolent laugh rang out gaily as he
mouthed the speech of Tybalt in actor fashion.</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;&#8216;What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word,</p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Have at thee, coward.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>I drew back from his playful lunge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. Have it your own way. But you
must have some one to act for you. Perhaps Captain
Mac&mdash;er&mdash;the gentleman on your right&mdash;will second
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Donald Roy drew himself up haughtily. &#8220;Feint a
bit of it! I&#8217;m on the other side of the dyke. Man,
Montagu! I&#8217;m wondering at you, and him wronging
a Hieland lassie. Gin he waits till I stand back of
him he&#8217;ll go wantin&#8217;, ye may lippen (trust) to that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;ll have to be you, Tony,&#8221; I said, turning
to Creagh. &#8220;Guard, Sir Robert!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Sdeath! You&#8217;re getting in a hurry, Mr. Montagu.
I see you&#8217;re keen after that &#8216;Hic Jacet&#8217; I
promised you. Lard! I vow you shall have it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the shifting moonlight we fell to work on the
dripping heath. We were not unevenly matched considering
the time and the circumstances. I had in my
favour youth, an active life, and a wrist of steel. At
least I was a strong swordsman, even though I could
not pretend to anything like the mastery of the weapon
which he possessed. To some extent his superior
skill was neutralized by the dim light. He had been
used to win his fights as much with his head as with
his hand, to read his opponent&#8217;s intention in advance
from the eyes while he concealed his own; but the
darkness, combined with my wooden face, made this
impossible now. Every turn and trick of the game
he knew, but the shifting shine and shadow disconcerted
him. More than once I heard him curse softly
when at a critical moment the scudding clouds drifted
across the moon in time to save me.</p>
<p>He had the better of me throughout, but somehow
I blundered through without letting him find the
chance for which he looked. I kept my head, and
parried by sheer luck his brilliant lunges. I broke
ground and won free&mdash;if but barely&mdash;from his incessant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
attack. More than once he pricked me. A
high thrust which I diverted too late with the parade
of tierce drew blood freely. He fleshed me again on
the riposte by a one-two feint in tierce and a thrust in
carte.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;L&#8217;art de donner et de ne pas recevoir,&#8217;&#8221; he
quoted, as he parried my counter-thrust with debonair
ease.</p>
<p>Try as I would I could not get behind that wonderful
guard of his. It was easy, graceful, careless
almost, but it was sure. His point was a gleaming
flash of light, but it never wavered from my body line.</p>
<p>A darker cloud obscured the moon, and by common
consent we rested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three minutes for good-byes,&#8221; said Volney, suggestively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my friends need not order the hearse yet&mdash;at
least for me. Of course, if it would be any convenience&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed. &#8220;Faith, you improve on acquaintance,
Mr. Montagu, like good wine or&mdash;to stick to the same
colour&mdash;the taste of the lady&#8217;s lips.&#8221;</p>
<p>I looked blackly at him. &#8220;Do you pretend&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I pretend nothing. Kiss and never tell, egad!
Too bad they&#8217;re not for you too, Montagu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see that Sir Robert Volney has added another
accomplishment to his vices.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And that is&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He can couple a woman&#8217;s name with the hint of a
slanderous lie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir Robert turned to Creagh and waved a hand at
me, shaking his head sorrowfully. &#8220;The country
boor in evidence again. Curious how it will crop out.
Ah, Mr. Montagu! The moon shines bright again.
Shall we have the pleasure of renewing our little debate?&#8221;</p>
<p>I nodded curtly. He stopped a moment to say:</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a strong wrist and a prodigious good
fence, Mr. Montagu, but if you will pardon a word of
criticism I think your guard too high.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Y&#8217;are not here to instruct me, Sir Robert,
but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To kill you. Quite so!&#8221; he interrupted jauntily.
&#8220;Still, a friendly word of caution&mdash;and the guard <i>is</i>
overhigh! &#8217;Tis the same fault my third had. I ran
under it, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was that the boy you killed for defending his
sister?&#8221; I asked insolently.</p>
<p>Apparently my hit did not pierce the skin. &#8220;No.
I&#8217;ve forgot the nomination of the gentleman. What
matter? He has long been food for worms. Pardon
me, I see blood trickling down your sword arm.
Allow me to offer my kerchief.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks! &#8217;Twill do as it is. Art ready?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Lard, yes! And guard lower, an you love me.
The high guard is the one fault&mdash; Well parried,
Montagu!&mdash;I find in Angelo&#8217;s pupils. Correcting
that, you would have made a rare swordsman in time.&#8221;</p>
<p>His use of the subjunctive did not escape me.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not dead yet,&#8221; I panted.</p>
<p>I parried a feint une-deux, in carte, with the parade
in semicircle, and he came over my blade, thrusting
low in carte. His laugh rang out clear as a boy&#8217;s,
and the great eyes of the man blazed with the joy of
fight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gad, you&#8217;re quick to take my meaning! Ah!
You nearly began the long journey that time, my
friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had broken ground apparently in disorder, and
by the feel of his sword I made sure he had in mind
to parry; but the man was as full of tricks as the
French King Louis and with incredible swiftness he
sent a straight thrust in high tierce&mdash;a thrust which
sharply stung my ribs only, since I had flung myself
aside in time to save my vitals.</p>
<p>After that came the end. He caught me full and
fair in the side of the neck. A moist stifling filled
my throat and the turf whirled up to meet the sky. I
knew nothing but a mad surge of rage that he had
cut me to pieces and I had never touched him once.
As I went down I flung myself forward at him wildly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
It is to be supposed that he was off guard for the moment,
supposing me a man already dead. My blade
slipped along his, lurched farther forward, at last
struck something soft and ripped down. A hundred
crimson points zigzagged before my eyes, and I
dropped down into unconsciousness in a heap.</p>

<h2>V</h2>
<h3>THE HUE AND CRY</h3>
</div>

<p>Languidly I came back to a world that
faded and grew clear again most puzzlingly,
that danced and jerked to and fro in oddly
irresponsible fashion. At first too deadly weary to
explain the situation to myself, I presently made out
that I was in a coach which lurched prodigiously and
filled me with sharp pains. Fronting me was the apparently
lifeless body of a man propped in the corner
with the head against the cushions, the white face
grinning horridly at me. &#8217;Twas the face of Volney.
I stirred to get it out of my line of vision, and a soft,
firm hand restrained me gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not to be stirring,&#8221; a sweet voice said.
Then to herself its owner added, ever so softly and so
happily, &#8220;Thaing do Dhia (Thank God.) He iss
alive&mdash;he iss alive!&#8221;</p>
<p>I pointed feebly a leaden finger at the white face
over against me with the shine of the moon on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. He hass just fainted. You are not to talk!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Donald Roy&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></p>
<p>The imperious little hand slipped down to cover my
mouth, and Kenneth Montagu kissed it where it lay.
For a minute she did not lift the hand, what time I
lay in a dream of warm happiness. A chuckle from
the opposite seat aroused me. The eyes in the
colourless face had opened, and Volney sat looking at
us with an ironic smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must have fallen asleep&mdash;and before a lady. A
thousand apologies! And for awaking so inopportunely,
ten thousand more!&#8221;</p>
<p>He changed his position that he might look the
easier at her, a half-humorous admiration in his eyes.
&#8220;Sweet, you beggar my vocabulary. As the goddess
of healing you are divine.&#8221;</p>
<p>The flush of alarmed maiden modesty flooded her
cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are to lie still, else the wound will break out
again,&#8221; she said sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith, it has broken out,&#8221; he feebly laughed, pretending
to misunderstand. Then, &#8220;Oh, you mean the
sword cut. &#8217;Twould never open after it has been
dressed by so fair a leech.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl looked studiously out of the coach window
and made no answer. Now, weak as I was&mdash;in pain
and near to death, my head on her lap with her dear
hand to cool my fevered brow&mdash;yet was I fool enough
to grow insanely jealous that she had used her kerchief
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
to bind his wound. His pale, handsome face
was so winning and his eyes so beautiful that they
thrust me through the heart as his sword had been
unable to do.</p>
<p>He looked at me with an odd sort of friendliness,
the respect one man has for another who has faced
death without flinching.</p>
<p>&#8220;Egad, Montagu, had either of us driven but a
finger&#8217;s breadth to left we had made sure work and
saved the doctors a vast deal of pother. I doubt
&#8217;twill be all to do over again one day. Where did
you learn that mad lunge of yours? I vow &#8217;tis none
of Angelo&#8217;s teaching. No defense would avail against
such a fortuitous stroke. Methought I had you
speeding to kingdom come, and Lard! you skewered
me bravely. &#8217;Slife, &#8217;tis an uncertain world, this!
Here we ride back together to the inn and no man
can say which of us has more than he can carry.&#8221;</p>
<p>All this with his easy dare-devil smile, though his
voice was faint from weakness. An odd compound
of virtues and vices this man! I learnt afterwards
that he had insisted on my wounds being dressed before
he would let them touch him, though he was
bleeding greatly.</p>
<p>But I had no mind for badinage, and I turned my
face from him sullenly. Silence fell till we jolted into
the courtyard of &#8220;The Jolly Soldier,&#8221; where Creagh,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
Macdonald, and Hamish Gorm, having dismounted
from their horses, waited to carry us into the house.
We were got to bed at once, and our wounds looked
to more carefully. By an odd chance Volney and I
were put in the same room, the inn being full, and
the Macdonald nursed us both, Creagh being for the
most part absent in London on business connected
with the rising.</p>
<p>Lying there day after day, the baronet and I came
in time to an odd liking for each other, discussing our
affairs frankly with certain reservations. Once he
commented on the strangeness of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;A singular creature is man, Montagu! Here are
we two as friendly as&mdash;as brothers I had almost said,
but most brothers hate each other with good cause.
At all events here we lie with nothing but good-will;
we are too weak to get at each other&#8217;s throats and so
perforce must endure each the other&#8217;s presence, and
from mere sufferance come to a mutual&mdash;shall I say
esteem? A while since we were for slaying; naught
but cold steel would let out our heat; and now&mdash;I
swear I have for you a vast liking. Will it last, think
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Till we are on our feet again. No longer,&#8221; I
answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you are right,&#8221; he replied, with the first
touch of despondency I had ever heard in his voice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
&#8220;The devil of it is that when I want a thing I never
rest till I get it, and after I have won it I don&#8217;t care
any more for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m an obstinate man myself,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know. And when I say I&#8217;ll do a thing
and you say I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t nothing on earth can keep us
from the small sword.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you never spare a victim&mdash;never draw back
before the evil was done?&#8221; I asked curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many a time, but never when the incentive to the
chase was so great as now. &#8217;Tis the overcoming of
obstacles I cannot resist. In this case&mdash;to pass by
the acknowledged charms of the lady&mdash;I find two
powerful reasons for continuing: her proud coyness
and your defense of her. Be sure I shall not fail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you will,&#8221; I answered quietly.</p>
<p>Out of doubt the man had a subtle fascination for
me, even though I hated his principles in the same
breath. When he turned the batteries of his fine
winning eyes and sparkling smile on me I was under
impulse to capitulate unconditionally; &#8217;twas at remembrance
of Aileen that my jaws set like a vice
again.</p>
<p>But as the days passed I observed a gradual change
in Volney&#8217;s attitude toward the Highland lass. Macdonald
had found a temporary home for her at the
house of a kind-hearted widow woman who lived in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
the neighbourhood, and so long as we were in danger
the girl and her grey-haired friend came often to offer
their services in nursing. Aileen treated the baronet
with such shy gentle womanliness, her girlish pity
struggling through the Highland pride, forgetting in
the suffering man the dastard who had wronged her,
that he was moved not a little from his cynical ironic
gayety. She was in a peculiar relation toward us,
one lacking the sanction of society and yet quite natural.
I had fought for her, and her warm heart forbade
her to go her way and leave me to live or die as
chance might will. As she would move about the
room ministering to our wants, wrapped in her sweet
purity and grace, more than once I caught on his face
a pain of wistfulness that told me of another man beneath
the polished heartless Macaroni. For the moment
I knew he repented him of his attempted wrong,
though I could not know that a day of manly reparation
would come to blot out his sin against her.</p>
<p>As we grew better Aileen&#8217;s visits became shorter
and less frequent, so that our only temptation to
linger over our illness was removed. One day Sir
Robert limped slowly across the floor on the arm of
Creagh while I watched him enviously. From that
time his improvement was rapid and within a week he
came to make his adieux to me. Dressed point-devise,
he was once more every inch a fop.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t say good-bye, Montagu, to either you or
the lady, because I expect to see you both again soon.
I have a shot in my locker that will bring you to
mighty short one of these days. Tony Creagh is going
to London with me in my coach. Sorry you and
the lady won&#8217;t take the other two seats. Well, au
revoir. Hope you&#8217;ll be quite fit when you come up
for the next round.&#8221; And waving a hand airily at me
he went limping down the stairs, devoid of grace yet
every motion eloquent of it, to me a living paradox.</p>
<p>Nor was it long before I too was able to crawl out
into the sunshine with Aileen Macleod and Captain
Macdonald as my crutches. Not far from the inn was
a grove of trees, and in it a rustic seat or two. Hither
we three repaired for many a quiet hour of talk.
Long ago Donald had established his relationship
with Aileen. It appeared that he was a cousin about
eight degrees removed. None but a Highlander
would have counted it at all, but for them it sufficed.
Donald Roy had an extraordinary taking way with
women, and he got on with the girl much more easily
than I did. Indeed, to hear them daffing with each
other one would have said they had been brought up
together instead of being acquaintances of less than
three weeks standing.</p>
<p>Yet Donald was so clever with it all that I was
never the least jealous of him. He was forever taking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
pains to show me off well before her, making as much
of my small attainments as a hen with one chick.
Like many of the West country Highlanders he was
something of a scholar. French he could speak like
a native, and he had dabbled in the humanities; but
he would drag forth my smattering of learning with
so much glee that one might have thought him ignorant
of the plainest A B C of the matter. More
than once I have known him blunder in a Latin quotation
that I might correct him. Aileen and he had a
hundred topics in common from which I was excluded
by reason of my ignorance of the Highlands, but the
Macdonald was as sly as a fox on my behalf. He
would draw out the girl about the dear Northland
they both loved and then would suddenly remember
that his pistols needed cleaning or that, he had promised
to &#8220;crack&#8221; with some chance gentleman stopping
at the inn, and away he would go, leaving us two
alone. While I lay on the grass and looked at her
Aileen would tell me in her eager, impulsive way
about her own kindly country, of tinkling, murmuring
burns, of hills burnt red with the heather, of a hundred
wild flowers that blossomed on the braes of Raasay,
and as she talked of them her blue eyes sparkled like
the sun-kissed lochs themselves.</p>
<p>Ah! Those were the good days, when the wine of
life was creeping back into my blood and I was falling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
forty fathoms deep in love. Despite myself she was
for making a hero of me, and my leal-hearted friend,
Macdonald, was not a whit behind, though the droll
look in his eyes suggested sometimes an ulterior motive.
We talked of many things, but in the end we
always got back to the one subject that burned like a
flame in their hearts&mdash;the rising of the clans that was
to bring back the Stuarts to their own. Their pure
zeal shamed my cold English caution. I found myself
growing keen for the arbitrament of battle.</p>
<p>No earthly Paradise endures forever. Into those
days of peace the serpent of my Eden projected his
sting. We were all sitting in the grove one morning
when a rider dashed up to the inn and flung himself
from his horse. &#8217;Twas Tony Creagh, and he carried
with him a placard which offered a reward of a hundred
guineas for the arrest of one Kenneth Montagu,
Esquire, who had, with other parties unknown, on the
night of July first, robbed Sir Robert Volney of certain
jewelry therein described.</p>
<p>&#8220;Highwayman it says,&#8221; quoth I in frowning perplexity.
&#8220;But Volney knows I had no mind to rob
him. Zounds! What does he mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mean? Why, to get rid of you! I tore this
down from a tavern wall in London just after &#8217;twas
pasted. It seems you forgot to return the gentleman
his jewelry.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>I turned mighty red and pleaded guilty.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so. Gad! You&#8217;re like to keep sheep
by moonlight,&#8221; chuckled Creagh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! They would never hang me,&#8221; I cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t, eh! Deed, and I&#8217;m not so sure. The
hue and cry is out for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Havers, man!&#8221; interrupted Macdonald sharply.
&#8220;You&#8217;re frightening the lady with your fairy tales,
Creagh. Don&#8217;t you be believing him, my dear. The
hemp is not grown that will hang Kenneth.&#8221;</p>
<p>But for all his cheery manner we were mightily
taken aback, especially when another rider came in a
few minutes later with a letter to me from town. It
ran:&mdash;</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Montagu</span>,</p>
<p>&#8220;Once more unto the breach, dear friends.&#8221; Our
pleasant little game is renewed. The first trick was, I
believe, mine; the second yours. The third I trump
by lodging an information against you for highway
robbery. Tony I shall not implicate, of course, nor
Mac-What&#8217;s-His-Name. Take wings, my Fly-by-night,
for the runners are on your heels, and if you
don&#8217;t, as I live, you&#8217;ll wear hemp. Give my devoted
love to the lady. I am,</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style=' margin-right:6em;'>Your most obed<sup>t</sup> serv<sup>t</sup> to command,</p>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Rob<sup>t</sup> Volney</span>.</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>In imagination I could see him seated at his table,
pushing aside a score of dainty notes from Phyllis indiscreet
or passionate Diana, that he might dash off
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
his warning to me, a whimsical smile half-blown on
his face, a gleam of sardonic humour in his eyes. Remorseless
he was by choice, but he would play the
game with an English sportsman&#8217;s love of fair play.
Eliminating his unscrupulous morals and his acquired
insolence of manner, Sir Robert Volney would have
been one to esteem; by impulse he was one of the
finest gentlemen I have known.</p>
<p>Though Creagh had come to warn me of Volney&#8217;s
latest move, he was also the bearer of a budget of
news which gravely affected the State at large and
the cause on which we were embarked. The French
fleet of transports, delayed again and again by trivial
causes, had at length received orders to postpone indefinitely
the invasion of England. Yet in spite of
this fatal blow to the cause it was almost certain that
Prince Charles Edward Stuart with only seven companions,
of whom one was the ubiquitous O&#8217;Sullivan,
had slipped from Belleisle on the Doutelle and escaping
the British fleet had landed on the coast of
Scotland. The emotions which animated us on hearing
of the gallant young Prince&#8217;s daring and romantic
attempt to win a Kingdom with seven swords, trusting
sublimely in the loyalty of his devoted Highlanders,
may better be imagined than described.
Donald Roy flung up his bonnet in a wild hurrah,
Aileen beamed pride and happiness, and Creagh&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
volatile Irish heart was in the hilltops. If I had any
doubts of the issue I knew better than to express
them.</p>
<p>But we were shortly recalled to our more immediate
affairs. Before we got back to the inn one
of those cursed placards offering a reward for my arrest
adorned the wall, and in front of it a dozen open-mouthed
yokels were spelling out its purport. Clearly
there was no time to be lost in taking Volney&#8217;s advice.
We hired a chaise and set out for London
within the hour. &#8217;Twas arranged that Captain Macdonald
and Hamish Gorm should push on at once to
Montagu Grange with Aileen, while I should lie in
hiding at the lodgings of Creagh until my wounds
permitted of my travelling without danger. That
Volney would not rest without attempting to discover
the whereabouts of Miss Macleod I was well assured,
and no place of greater safety for the present occurred
to me than the seclusion of the Grange with my
brother Charles and the family servants to watch over
her. As for myself, I was not afraid of their hanging
me, but I was not minded to play into the hands of
Volney by letting myself get cooped up in prison for
many weeks pending a trial while he renewed his
cavalier wooing of the maid.</p>
<p>Never have I spent a more doleful time than that
which followed. For one thing my wounds healed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
badly, causing me a good deal of trouble. Then too
I was a prisoner no less than if I had been in The
Tower itself. If occasionally at night I ventured
forth the fear of discovery was always with me. Tony
Creagh was the best companion in the world, at once
tender as a mother and gay as a schoolboy, but he
could not be at home all day and night, and as he
was agog to be joining the Prince in the North he
might leave any day. Meanwhile he brought me the
news of the town from the coffee-houses: how Sir
Robert Walpole was dead; how the Camerons under
Lochiel, the Macdonalds under Young Clanranald,
and the Macphersons under Cluny had rallied to the
side of the Prince and were expected soon to be defeated
by Sir John Cope, the Commander-in-Chief of
the Government army in Scotland; how Balmerino
and Leath had already shipped for Edinburgh to join
the insurgent army; how Beauclerc had bet Lord
March a hundred guineas that the stockings worn by
Lady Di Faulkner at the last Assembly ball were not
mates, and had won. It appeared that unconsciously
I had been a source of entertainment to the club
loungers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure &#8217;tis pity you&#8217;re mewed up here, Kenn, for
you&#8217;re the lion of the hour. None can roar like you.
The betting books at White&#8217;s are filled with wagers
about you,&#8221; Creagh told me.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>&#8220;About me?&#8221; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith, who else? &#8216;Lord Pam bets Mr. Conway
three ponies against a hundred pounds that Mr.
Kenneth Montagu of Montagu Grange falls by the
hand of justice before three months from date,&#8217;&#8221; he
quoted with a great deal of gusto. &#8220;Does your neck
ache, Kenn?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the odds are in my favour yet. What else?&#8221;
I asked calmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mr. James Haddon gives ten pounds each to his
Royal Highness the Prince of Wales and to Sir
Robert Volney and is to receive from each twenty
guineas if Mr. K. Montagu is alive twelve months
from date.&#8217; Egad, you&#8217;re a topic of interest in high
quarters!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Honoured, I&#8217;m sure! I&#8217;ll make it a point to see
that his Royal Highness and my dear friend Volney
lose. Anything else?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At the coffee-house they were talking about raising
a subscription to you because they hear you&#8217;re
devilish hard up and because you made such a plucky
fight against Volney. Some one mentioned that you
had a temper and were proud as Lucifer. &#8216;He&#8217;s such
a hothead. How&#8217;ll he take it?&#8217; asks Beauclerc.
&#8216;Why, quarterly, to be sure!&#8217; cries Selwyn. And
that reminds me: George has written an epigram that
is going the rounds. Out of some queer whim&mdash;to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
keep them warm I suppose&mdash;Madame Bellevue took
her slippers to bed with her. Some one told it at the
club, so Selwyn sat down and wrote these verses:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;&#8216;Well may Suspicion shake its head&mdash;</p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>Her very shoes&mdash;because they&#8217;re fellows.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Creagh&#8217;s merry laugh was a source of healing in
itself, and his departure to join the Prince put an edge
to the zest of my desire to get back into the world.
Just before leaving he fished a letter from his pocket
and tossed it across the room to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Egad, and you are the lucky man, Kenn,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;The ladies pester us with praises of your valour.
This morning one of the fair creatures gave me this to
deliver, swearing I knew your whereabouts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas a gay little note from my former playmate
Antoinette Westerleigh, and inclosed was a letter to
her from my sister. How eagerly I devoured Cloe&#8217;s
letter for news of Aileen may be guessed.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>My Dearest &#8217;Toinette</span>:&mdash;</p>
<p>Since last I saw you (so the letter ran) seems a
century, and of course I am dying to come to town.
No doubt the country is very healthy, but Lud! &#8217;tis
monstrous dull after a London season. I vow I am
already a lifetime behind the fashions. Is&#8217;t true that
prodigious bustles are the rage? And while I think
of it I wish you would call at Madame Ronald&#8217;s and
get the lylack lute-string scirt she is making for me.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></div>
<p>Also at Duprez&#8217;s for the butifull little hat I ordered.
Please have them sent by carrier. I know I am a vast
nuisance; &#8217;tis the penalty, my dear, for having a country
mawkin as your best friend.</p>
<p>Of course you know what that grate brother of mine
has been at. Gaming I hear, playing ducks and
drakes with his money, and fighting duels with your
lover. For a time we were dreadfully anxious about
him. What do you think he has sent me down to
take care of for him? But you would never guess.
My love, a Scotch girl, shy as one of her own mountain
deer. I suppose when he is recovert of his
wounds he will be down here to philander with her.
Aileen Macleod is her name, and really I do not blame
him. I like her purely myself. In a way quite new she
is very taking; speaks the prettiest broken English, is
very simple, sweet, and grateful. At a word the pink
and white comes and goes in her cheeks as it never
does in ours. I wish I could acquire her manner, but
Alack! &#8217;tis not to be learnt though I took lessons forever.
The gracefull creature dances the Scottish flings
divinely. She is not exactly butifull, but&mdash;well, I can
see why the men think so and fall down in worship!
By the way, she is very nearly in love&mdash;tho she does
not know it&mdash;with that blundering brother of mine;
says that &#8220;her heart iss always thanking him at all
events.&#8221; If he knew how to play his cards&mdash;but there,
the oaf will put his grate foot in it.</p>
<p>She came here with a shag-headed gillie of a servant,
under the protection of a Captain Macdonald
who is a very fine figure of a man. He was going to
stay only an hour or two, but <i>Charles</i> persuaded him
to stop three days. Charles teases me about him,
swears the Captain is already my slave, but you may
depend on&#8217;t there is nothing in it. Last night we
diverted ourselves with playing Hide the Thimble,
and the others lost the Scotch Captain and me in the</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></div>
<p>armory. He is a peck of fun. This morning he left for
the North, and do you think the grate Mr. Impudence
did not buss us both; Aileen because she is his cousin a
hundred times removed and me because (what a reason!)
&#8220;my eyes dared him.&#8221; Of course I was in a vast
rage, which seemed to hily delight Captain Impudence.
I don&#8217;t see how he dared take so grate a preaviledge.
Do you?</p>
<p>Aileen is almost drest, and I must go smart myself.
My dear, an you love me, write to</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p>Your own <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Cloe</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>P. S.&mdash;Lard, I clear forgot! &#8217;Tis a secret that the
Scotch enchantress is here. You must be sure not to
mention it, my dear, to your Sir Robert, But la! I
have the utmost confidence in your discretion.</p>
</div>
<p>Conceive my dismay! Discretion and Antoinette
Westerleigh were as far apart as the poles. What
more likely than that the dashing little minx would
undertake to rally her lover about Aileen, and that
the adroit baronet would worm out of her the information
he desired? The letter crystallized my desire to
set out at once for Montagu Grange, and from there
to take the road with Miss Macleod hotspur for Scotland.
It appeared to me that the sooner we were out
of England the better it would be for both of us.</p>
<p>I made the journey to the Grange by easy stages,
following so far as I could little used roads and lanes
on account of a modest desire to avoid publicity.
&#8217;Twas early morning when I reached the Grange. I
remember the birds were twittering a chorus as I rode
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
under the great oaks to the house. Early as it was,
Cloe and Aileen were already walking in the garden
with their arms entwined about each other&#8217;s waists in
girl fashion. They made a picture taking enough to
have satisfied a jaded connoisseur of beauty: the fair
tall Highland lass, jimp as a willow wand, with the
long-lashed blue eyes that looked out so shyly and yet
so frankly on those she liked, and the merry brown-eyed
English girl so ready of saucy tongue, so worldly
wise and yet so innocent of heart.</p>
<p>Cloe came running to meet me in a flutter of excitement
and Mistress Aileen followed more demurely
down the path, though there was a Highland welcome
in her frank face not to be denied. I slid from the
horse and kissed Cloe. Miss Macleod gave me her
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are hoping you are quite well from your
wounds,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;Better much for hearing
your kind voices and seeing your bright faces.&#8221;</p>
<p>I dare say I looked over-long into one of the bright
faces, and for a punishment was snatched into confusion
by my malapert sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you had heard my kind voice yet,&#8221;
mimicked Miss Madcap. &#8220;And are you thinking of
holding Aileen&#8217;s hand all day?&#8221;</p>
<p>My hand plumped to my side like a shot. Both of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
us flamed, I stammering apologies the while Cloe no
doubt enjoyed hugely my embarrassment. &#8217;Tis a
sister&#8217;s prerogative to teach her older brothers humility,
and Cloe for one did not let it fall into neglect.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure I do not know the Highland custom
in the matter,&#8221; she was continuing complacently when
Aileen hoist her with her own petard.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wass thinking that perhaps Captain Macdonald
had taught you in the armory,&#8221; she said quietly; and
Cloe, to be in the fashion, ran up the red flag too.</p>
<p>It appeared that my plan for an immediate departure
from England jumped with the inclination of Miss
Macleod. She had received a letter from her brother,
now in Scotland, whose plans in regard to her had
been upset by the unexpected arrival of the Prince.
He was extremely solicitous on her behalf, but could
only suggest for her an acceptance of a long-standing
invitation to visit Lady Strathmuir, a distant relative
living in Surrey, until times grew more settled. To
Aileen the thought of throwing herself upon the hospitality
of one she had never met was extremely distasteful,
and she hailed my proposal as an alternative
much to be desired.</p>
<p>The disagreeable duty of laying before my lawyer
the involved condition of my affairs had to be endured,
and I sent for him at once to get it over with
the sooner. He pulled a prodigious long face at my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
statement of the gaming debts I had managed to contract
during my three months&#8217; experiment as the
prodigal son in London, but though he was extraordinarily
severe with me I made out in the end that affairs
were not so bad as I had thought. The estate would
have to be plastered with a mortgage, but some years
of stiff economy and retrenchment, together with a
ruthless pruning of the fine timber, would suffice to
put me on my feet again. The expenditures of the
household would have to be cut down, but Mr. Brief
thought that a modest establishment befitting my
rank might still be maintained. If I thought of
marrying&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>A ripple of laughter from the lawn, where Aileen
and Charles were arranging fishing tackle, was wafted
through the open window and cut athwart the dry
speech of the lawyer. My eyes found her and lingered
on the soft curves, the rose-leaf colouring, the
eager face framed in a sunlit aureola of radiant hair.
Already my mind had a trick of imagining her the
mistress of the Grange. Did she sit for a moment in
the seat that had been my mother&#8217;s my heart sang;
did she pluck a posy or pour a cup of tea &#8217;twas the
same. &#8220;If I thought of marrying&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Well, &#8217;twas
a thing to be considered one day&mdash;when I came back
from the wars.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>IN THE MATTER OF A KISS</h3>
</div>

<p>It may be guessed that the music of the gray
morn when we started found a ready echo in my
heart. The whistle of a plover cut the breaking
day, the meadow larks piped clear above us in chorus
with the trilling of the thrush, the wimpling burn
tinkled its song, and the joy that took me fairly by
the throat was in tune with all of them. For what
does a lover ask but to be one and twenty, to be
astride a willing horse, and to be beside the one
woman in the world for him? Sure &#8217;tis heaven
enough to watch the colour come and go in her face, to
hear the lilt of her voice, and to see the changing
light in her eye. What though at times we were shy
as the wild rabbit, we were none the less happy for
that. In our hearts there bubbled a childlike gaiety;
we skipped upon the sunlit hilltops of life.</p>
<p>And here was the one drop of poison in the honey
of my cup: that I was wearing an abominable misfit
of a drab-coloured suit of homespun more adapted to
some village tradesman than to a young cavalier of
fashion, for on account of the hue and cry against me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
I had pocketed my pride and was travelling under an
incognito. Nor did it comfort me one whit that
Aileen also was furbished up in sombre gray to represent
my sister, for she looked so taking in it that I
vow &#8217;twas more becoming than her finery. Yet I
made the best of it, and many a good laugh we got
from rehearsing our parts.</p>
<p>I can make no hand at remembering what we had
to say to each other, nor does it matter; in cold type
&#8217;twould lose much of its charm. The merry prattle
of her pretty broken English was set to music for me,
and the very silences were eloquent of thrill. Early I
discovered that I had not appreciated fully her mental
powers, on account of a habit she had of falling into a
shy silence when several were present. She had a
nimble wit, an alert fancy, and a zest for life as earnest
as it was refreshing. A score of times that day she
was out of the shabby chaise to pick the wild flowers
or to chat with the children by the wayside. The
memory of her warm friendliness to me stands out the
more clear contrasted with the frigid days that followed.</p>
<p>It may be thought by some that our course in
travelling together bordered on the edge of the proprieties,
but it must be remembered that the situation
was a difficult one for us both. Besides which my
sister Cloe was always inclined to be independent, of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
a romantical disposition, and herself young; as for
Aileen, I doubt whether any thought of the conventions
crossed her mind. Her people would be wearying
to see her; her friend Kenneth Montagu had
offered his services to conduct her home; Hamish
Gorm was a jealous enough chaperone for any girl,
and the maid that Cloe had supplied would serve to
keep the tongues of the gossips from clacking.</p>
<p>We put up that first evening at The King&#8217;s Arms,
a great rambling inn of two stories which caught the
trade of many of the fashionable world on their way
to and from London. Aileen and I dined together at
a table in the far end of the large dining-room. As
I remember we were still uncommon merry, she
showing herself very clever at odd quips and turns of
expression. We found matter for jest in a large
placard on the wall, with what purported to be a picture
of me, the printed matter containing the usual
description and offer of reward. Watching her, I was
thinking that I had never known a girl more in love
with life or with so mobile a face when a large company
of arrivals from London poured gaily into the room.</p>
<p>They were patched and powdered as if prepared for
a ball rather than for the dust of the road. Dowagers,
frigid and stately as marble, murmured racy gossip to
each other behind their fans. Famous beauties flitted
hither and thither, beckoning languid fops with their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
alluring eyes. Wits and beaux sauntered about
elegantly even as at White&#8217;s. &#8217;Twas plain that this
was a party <i>en route</i> for one of the great county
houses near.</p>
<p>Aileen stared with wide-open eyes and parted lips
at these great dames from the fashionable world about
which she knew nothing. They were prominent
members of the leading school for backbiting in England,
and in ten minutes they had talked more scandal
than the Highland lass had heard before in a lifetime.
But the worst of the situation was that there was not
one of them but would cry &#8220;Montagu!&#8221; when they
clapped eyes on me. Here were Lord March, George
Selwyn, Sir James Craven, Topham Beauclerc, and
young Winton Westerleigh; Lady Di Davenport and
the Countess Dowager of Rocksboro; the Hon.
Isabel Stanford, Mistress Antoinette Westerleigh, and
others as well known to me. They had taken us at
unawares, and as Creagh would have put it in an Irish
bull the only retreat possible for us was an advance
through the enemy. At present they paid no more
attention to us than they would to the wooden negro
in front of a tobacco shop, but at any moment detection
might confront me. Faith, here was a predicament!
Conceive me, with a hundred guineas set
upon my head, thrust into the very company in all
England I would most have avoided.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>And of all the people in the world they chanced on
me as a topic of conversation. George Selwyn, strolling
up and down the room, for want of something
better to do, stopped in front of that confounded
placard and began reading it aloud. Now I don&#8217;t
mind being described as &#8220;Tall, strong, well-built, and
extremely good-looking; brown eyes and waving hair
like ilk; carries himself with distinction;&#8221; but I grue
at being set down as a common cutpurse, especially
when I had taken the trouble to send back Sir
Robert&#8217;s jewelry at some risk to myself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonder what Montagu has done with himself,&#8221;
queried Beauclerc after Selwyn had finished.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or what Volney has done with him,&#8221; muttered
March behind his hand. &#8220;I&#8217;ll lay two to one in
ponies he never lives to cross another man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wrong, March, if you think Volney finished
him. He&#8217;s alive all right. I heard it from
Denman that he got safe across to France. Pity Volney
didn&#8217;t pink the fellow through the heart for his
d&mdash;&mdash;d impudence in interfering; not that I can stand
Volney either, curse the popinjay!&#8221; snarled Craven
sourly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Montagu reaches the continent, &#8217;twill be a passover
the Jews who hold his notes will not relish,&#8221;
suggested Selwyn in his sleepy way.</p>
<p>A pink-and-white-faced youth shimmering in cream
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
satin was the animated heart of another group. His
love for scandal and his facility for acquiring the latest
tidbit made him the delight of many an old tabby
cat. Now his eyes shone with the joy of imparting a
delicious morsel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Egad, then, you&#8217;re all wrong,&#8221; he was saying in a
shrill falsetto. &#8220;Stap me, the way of it was this! I
have it on the best of authority and it comes direct,
rot me if it doesn&#8217;t! Sir Robert&#8217;s man, Watkins, told
Madame Bellevue&#8217;s maid, from whom it came straight
to Lord Pam&#8217;s fellow and through him to old Methuselah,
who mentioned it to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t finish tracing the lineage of the misinformation.
We&#8217;ll assume it began with Adam and
ended with a dam&mdash;with a descendant of his,&#8221; interrupted
Craven with his usual insolence. &#8220;Now
out with the lie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Pon honour, Craven, &#8217;tis gospel truth,&#8221; gasped
Pink-and-White.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better send for a doctor then. If he tries to tell
the truth for once he&#8217;ll strangle,&#8221; suggested Selwyn
whimsically to March.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spit it out then!&#8221; bullied Craven coarsely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Lard! Your roughness gives me the flutters,
Sir James. I&#8217;m all of a tremble. Split me, I can&#8217;t
abide to be scolded! Er&mdash; Well, then, &#8217;twas a
Welsh widow they fought about&mdash;name of Gwynne
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
and rich as Cr&oelig;sus&mdash;old enough to be a grandmother
of either of &#8217;em, begad! Volney had first claim and
Montagu cut in; swore he&#8217;d marry her if she went off
the hooks next minute. They fought and Montagu
fell at the first shot. Next day the old Begum ran off
with her footman. That&#8217;s the story, you may depend
on&#8217;t. Lud, yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may depend on its being wrong in every particular,&#8221;
agreed Lady Di coolly. &#8220;You&#8217;d better tell
the story, &#8217;Toinette. They&#8217;ll have it a hundred times
worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh Lard! Gossip about my future husband.
Not I!&#8221; giggled that lively young woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a prude, miss!&#8221; commanded the Dowager
Countess sharply. &#8220;&#8217;Tis to stifle false reports
you tell it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Slidikins! An you put it as a duty,&#8221; simpered
the young beauty. &#8220;&#8217;Twould seem that&mdash;it would
appear&mdash;the story goes that&mdash; Do I blush?&mdash;that
Sir Robert&mdash; Oh, let Lady Di tell it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Di came to scratch with the best will in the
world.</p>
<p>&#8220;To correct a false impression then; for no other
reason I tell it save to kill worse rumours. Everybody
knows I hate scandal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Slife, yes! Everybody knows that,&#8221; agreed
Craven, leering over at March.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sir Robert Volney then was much taken with a
Scotch girl who was visiting in London, and of course
she dreamed air castles and fell in love with him.
&#8217;Twas Joan and Darby all the livelong day, but
alack! the maid discovered, as maids will, that Sir
Robert&#8217;s intentions were&mdash;not of the best, and
straightway the blushing rose becomes a frigid icicle.
Well, this Northern icicle was not to be melted, and
Sir Robert was for trying the effect of a Surrey hothouse.
In her brother&#8217;s absence he had the maid abducted
and carried to a house of his in town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Slife! A story for a play. And what then?&#8221;
cried Pink-and-White.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why then&mdash;enter Mr. Montagu with a &#8216;Stay,
villain!&#8217; It chanced that young Don Quixote was
walking through the streets for the cooling of his
blood mayhap, much overheated by reason of deep
play. He saw, he followed, at a fitting time he broke
into the apartment of the lady. Here Sir Robert discovered
them&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The lady all unready, alackaday!&#8221; put in the
Honourable Isabel, from behind a fan to hide imaginary
blushes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, something easy of attire to say the least,&#8221;
admitted Lady Di placidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217; faith then, Montagu must make a better lover
than Sir Robert,&#8221; cried March.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Every lady to her taste. And later they fought
on the way to Surrey. Both wounded, no graves
needed. The girl nursed Montagu back to health, and
they fled to France together,&#8221; concluded the narrator.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the lady&mdash;is she such a beauty?&#8221; queried
Beauclerc.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slidikins! I don&#8217;t know. She must have points.
No Scotch mawkin would draw Sir Robert&#8217;s eye.&#8221;</p>
<p>You are to imagine with what a burning face I sat
listening to this devil&#8217;s brew of small talk. What
their eyes said to each other of innuendo, what their
lifted brows implied, and what they whispered behind
white elegant hands, was more maddening than the
open speech. For myself, I did not value the talk of
the cats at one jack straw, but for this young girl sitting
so still beside me&mdash; By Heaven, I dared not
look at her. Nor did I know what to do, how to stop
them without making the matter worse for her, and I
continued to sit in an agony grizzling on the gridiron
of their calumnies. Had they been talking lies outright
it might have been easily borne, but there was
enough of truth mixed in the gossip to burn the girl
with the fires of shame.</p>
<p>At the touch of a hand I turned to look into a
face grown white and chill, all the joy of life struck
out of it. The girl&#8217;s timorous eyes implored me to
spare her more of this scene.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh Kenneth, get me away from here. I will be
dying of shame. Let us be going at once,&#8221; she asked
in a low cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no way out except through the crowd of
them. Will you dare make the attempt? Should I
be recognized it may be worse for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not fearing if you go with me. And at all
events anything iss better than this.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a chance that we might pass through unobserved,
and I took it; but I was white-hot with
rage and I dare say my aggressive bearing bewrayed
me. In threading our way to the door I brushed accidentally
against Mistress Westerleigh. She drew
aside haughtily, then gave a little scream of recognition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kenn Montagu, of all men in the world&mdash;and
turned Quaker, too. Gog&#8217;s life, &#8217;tis mine, &#8217;tis mine!
The hundred guineas are mine. I call you all to witness
I have taken the desperate highwayman. &#8216;Tall,
strong, and extremely well-looking; carries himself
like a gentleman.&#8217; This way, sir,&#8221; she cried merrily,
and laying hold of my coat-tails began to drag me toward
the men.</p>
<p>There was a roar of laughter at this, and the pink-white
youth lounged forward to offer me a hand of
welcome I took pains not to see.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith, the lady has the right of it, Montagu. That
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
big body of yours is worth a hundred guineas now if
it never was before,&#8221; laughed Selwyn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry to disappoint the lady, but unfortunately my
business carries me in another direction,&#8221; I said
stiffly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Lud! &#8217;Tis not fair. You&#8217;re mine. I took
you, and I want the reward,&#8221; cries the little lady with
the sparkling eyes.</p>
<p>Aileen stood by my side like a queen cut out of
marble, turning neither to the right nor to the left, her
head poised regally on her fine shoulders as if she saw
none in the room worthy a look.</p>
<p>&#8220;This must be the baggage about which they
fought. Faith, as fine a piece as I have seen,&#8221; said
Craven to March in an audible aside, his bold eyes
fixed insolently on the Highland girl.</p>
<p>Aileen heard him, and her face flamed. I set my
teeth and swore to pay him for that some day, but I
knew this to be no fitting time for a brawl. Despite
me the fellow forced my hand. He planted himself
squarely in our way and ogled my charge with impudent
effrontery. Me he quite ignored, while his insulting
eyes raked her fore and aft. My anger seethed,
boiled over. Forward slid my foot behind his heel,
my forearm under his chin. I threw my weight forward
in a push. His head went back as though shot
from a catapult, and next moment Sir James Craven
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
measured his length on the ground. With the girl on
my arm I pushed through the company to the door.
They cackled after me like solan-geese, but I shut and
locked the door in their faces and led Aileen to her
room. She marched up the stairs like a goddess,
beautiful in her anger as one could desire. The
Gaelic heart is a good hater, and &#8217;twas quite plain
that Miss Macleod had inherited a capacity for anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;How dare they? How dare they? What have I
done that they should talk so? There are three hundred
claymores would be leaping from the scabbard
for this. My grief! That they would talk so of my
father&#8217;s daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was superbly beautiful in her wrath. It was
the black fury of the Highland loch in storm that
leaped now from her eyes. Like a caged and
wounded tigress she strode up and down the room,
her hands clenched and her breast heaving, an impetuous
flood of Gaelic pouring from her mouth.</p>
<p>For most strange logic commend me to a woman&#8217;s
reasoning, I had been in no way responsible for the
scene down-stairs, but somehow she lumped me blindly
with the others in her mind, at least so far as to
punish me because I had seen and heard. Apparently
&#8217;twas enough that I was of their race and class, for
when during a pause I slipped in my word of soothing
explanation the uncorked vials of her rage showered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
down on me. Faith, I began to think that old Jack
Falstaff had the right of it in his rating of discretion,
and the maid appearing at that moment I showed a
clean pair of heels and left her alone with her
mistress.</p>
<p>As I was descending the stairs a flunky in the livery
of the Westerleighs handed me a note. It was
from Antoinette, and in a line requested me to meet
her at once in the summer-house of the garden. In
days past I had coquetted many an hour away with
her. Indeed, years before we had been lovers in half-earnest
boy and girl fashion, and after that the best
of friends. Grimly I resolved to keep the appointment
and to tell this little worldling some things she
needed much to know.</p>
<p>I found her waiting. Her back was turned, and
though she must have heard me coming she gave no
sign. I was still angry at her for her share in what
had just happened and I waited coldly for her to begin.
She joined me in the eloquent silence of a
Quaker meeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I am here,&#8221; I said at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s you.&#8221; She turned on me, mighty cold
and haughty. &#8220;Sir, I take it as a great presumption
that you dare to stay at the same inn with me
after attempting to murder my husband that is to
be.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Murder!&#8221; I gasped, giving ground in dismay at
this unexpected charge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Murder was the word I used, sir. Do you not
like it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas a fair fight,&#8221; I muttered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it not you that challenged? Did you not
force it on him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then you dare to come philandering here
after me. Do you think I can change lovers as often
as gloves, sir? Or as often as you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Madam, I protest&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;La! You protest! Did you not come here to
see me? Answer me that, sir!&#8221; With an angry
stamp of her foot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mistress Westerleigh, your note&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And to philander? Do you deny it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Deny it. Odzooks, yes! &#8217;Tis the last thing I
have in my mind,&#8221; I rapped out mighty short. &#8220;I
have done with women and their follies. I begin to
see why men of sense prefer to keep their freedom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you, Kenn? And was the other lady so
hard on you? Did she make you pay for our follies?
Poor Kenn!&#8221; laughed my mocking tormentor with so
sudden a change of front that I was quite nonplussed.
&#8220;And did you think I did not know my rakehelly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
lover Sir Robert better than to blame you for his
quarrels?&#8221;</p>
<p>I breathed freer. She had taken the wind out of
my sails, for I had come purposing to give her a large
piece of my mind. Divining my intention, womanlike
she had created a diversion by carrying the war
into the country of the enemy.</p>
<p>She looked winsome in the extreme. Little dimples
ran in and out her peach-bloom cheeks. In her
eyes danced a kind of innocent devilry, and the alluring
mouth was the sweetest Cupid&#8217;s bow imaginable.
Laughter rippled over her face like the wind in
golden grain. Mayhap my eyes told what I was
thinking, for she asked in a pretty, audacious imitation
of the Scotch dialect Aileen was supposed to speak,</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I no&#8217; bonny, Kenneth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are that, &#8217;Toinette.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you love her better?&#8221; she said softly.</p>
<p>I told her yes.</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She turned and began to pull a
honeysuckle to pieces, pouting in the prettiest fashion
conceivable.</p>
<p>The graceful curves of the lithe figure provoked me.
There was a challenge in her manner, and my blood
beat with a surge. I made a step or two toward her.</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet?&#8221; I repeated, over her shoulder.</p>
<p>One by one the petals floated away.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There was a time&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She spoke so softly I
had to bend over to hear.</p>
<p>I sighed. &#8220;A thousand years ago, &#8217;Toinette.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But love is eternal, and in eternity a thousand
years are but as a day.&#8221;</p>
<p>The long curving lashes were lifted for a moment,
and the dancing brown eyes flashed into mine.
While mine held them they began to dim. On my
soul the little witch contrived to let the dew of tears
glisten there. Now a woman&#8217;s tears are just the one
thing Kenneth Montagu cannot resist. After all I am
not the first man that has come to make war and
stayed to make love.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Toinette! &#8217;Toinette!&#8221; I chided, resolution melting
fast.</p>
<p>&#8220;And y&#8217;are commanded to love your neighbours,
Kenn.&#8221;</p>
<p>I vow she was the takingest madcap in all England,
and not the worst heart neither. I am no Puritan,
and youth has its day in which it will be served. My
scruples took wing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith, one might travel far and not do better,&#8221; I
told her. &#8220;When the gods send their best to a man
he were a sorry knave to complain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet I stood helpless, in longing desire and yet
afraid to dare. No nicety of conscience held me now,
rather apprehension. I had not lived my one and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
twenty years without learning that a young woman
may be free of speech and yet discreet of action, that
alluring eyes are oft mismated with prim maiden conscience.
&#8217;Tis in the blood of some of them to throw
down the gauntlet to a man&#8217;s courage and then to
trample on him for daring to accept the challenge.</p>
<p>Her eyes derided me. A scoffing smile crept into
that mocking face of hers. No longer I shilly-shallied.
She had brought me to dance, and she must pay the piper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Modesty is a sweet virtue, but it doesn&#8217;t butter
any bread,&#8221; I cried gaily. &#8220;Egad, I embrace my
temptation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which same I did, and the temptress too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I your temptation, Adam?&#8221; quoth the lady
presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I vow y&#8217;are the fairest enticement, Eve, that ever
trod the earth since the days of the first Garden. For
this heaven of your lips I&#8217;ll pay any price in reason.
A year in purgatory were cheap&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>I stopped, my florid eloquence nipped in bud, for
the lady had suddenly begun to disengage herself.
Her glance shot straight over my shoulder to the entrance
of the summer-house. Divining the presence of
an intruder, I turned.</p>
<p>Aileen was standing in the doorway looking at us
with an acrid, scornful smile that went to my heart like
a knife.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>MY LADY RAGES</h3>
</div>

<p>I was shaken quite out of my exultation. I
stood raging at myself in a defiant scorn, struck
dumb at the folly that will let a man who loves
one woman go sweethearting with another. Her eyes
stabbed me, the while I stood there dogged yet
grovelling, no word coming to my dry lips. What
was there to be said? The tie that bound me to
Aileen was indefinable, tenuous, not to be phrased; yet
none the less it existed. I stood convicted, for I had
tacitly given her to understand that no woman found
place in my mind save her, and at the first chance she
found another in my arms. Like a detected schoolboy
in presence of the rod I awaited my sentence, my
heart a trip-hammer, my face a picture of chagrin and
dread.</p>
<p>For just a moment she held me in the balance with
that dreadful smile on her face, my day of judgment
come to earth, then turned and away without a word.
I flung wildly after her, intent on explaining what could
not be explained. In the night I lost her and went
up and down through the shrubbery calling her to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
come forth, beating the currant and gooseberry bushes
in search of her. A shadow flitted past me toward
the house, and at the gate I intercepted the girl.
Better I had let her alone. My heart misgave me at
sight of her face; indeed the whole sweep of her lithesome
reedy figure was pregnant with Highland scorn
and pride.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Aileen, in the arbour&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; I was beginning,
when she cut me short.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I am thinking I owe you an apology for my
intrusion. In troth, Mr. Montagu, my interruption of
your love-makings was not intentional.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her voice gave me the feel of being drenched with
ice-water.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will let me explain, Aileen&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, and there iss nothing to explain, sir. It
will be none of my business who you are loving,
and&mdash; Will you open the gate, Mr. Montagu?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I must explain; &#8217;twas a madness of the blood.
You do not understand&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And gin I never understand, Mr. Montagu, the
lift (sky) will not fall. Here iss a great to-do about
nothing,&#8221; she flung back with a kind of bitter jauntiness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aileen,&#8221; I cried, a little wildly, &#8220;you will not cast
me off without a hearing. Somehow I must make it
clear, and you must try&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My name it iss Miss Macleod, and I would think it
clear enough already at all events. I will be thanking
you to let me pass, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her words bit, not less the scorch of her eyes. My
heart was like running water.</p>
<p>&#8220;And is this an end to all&mdash; Will you let so
small a thing put a period to our good comradeship?&#8221;
I cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since you mention it I would never deny that I
am under obligations to you, sir, which my brother
will be blithe to repay&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By Heaven, I never mentioned obligations; I never
thought of them. Is there no friendship in your heart
for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your regard iss a thing I have valued, but&#8221;&mdash;there
was a little break in the voice which she rode
over roughshod&mdash;&#8220;I can very well be getting along
without the friendships of that girl&#8217;s lover.&#8221;</p>
<p>She snatched open the gate and flung past me to
the house, this superb young creature, tall, slim, supple,
a very Diana in her rage, a woman too if one might
judge by the breasts billowing with rising sobs. More
slow I followed, quite dashed to earth. All that I had
gained by months of service in one moment had been
lost. She would think me another of the Volney
stamp, and her liking for me would turn to hate as
with him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>A low voice from the arbour called &#8220;Kenn!&#8221; But
I had had enough of gallivanting for one night and I
held my way sullenly to the house. Swift feet pattered
down the path after me, and presently a little
hand fell on my arm. I turned, sulky as a baited
bear.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so sorry, Kenn,&#8221; said Mistress Antoinette
demurely.</p>
<p>My sardonic laughter echoed cheerlessly. &#8220;That
there is no more mischief to your hand. Oh never
fear! You&#8217;ll find some other poor breeched gull
shortly.&#8221;</p>
<p>The brown dovelike eyes of the little rip reproached
me.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twill all come right, Kenn. She&#8217;ll never think
the worse of you for this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be no more to her than a glove outworn. I
have lost the only woman I could ever love, and
through my own folly, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alackaday, Kenn! Y&#8217; &#8217;ave much to learn about
women yet. She will think the more of you for it
when her anger is past.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not she. One of your fashionables might, but
not Aileen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh! I think better of her than you. She&#8217;s not
all milk and water. There&#8217;s red blood in her veins,
man. Spunk up and brazen it out. Cock your chin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
and whistle it off bravely. Faith, I know better men
than you who would not look so doleful over one of
&#8217;Toinette Westerleigh&#8217;s kisses. If I were a man I
would never kiss and be sorry for all the maids in
Christendom.&#8221;</p>
<p>The saucy piquant tilt to her chin was a sight for
the gods to admire.</p>
<p>&#8220;You forget I love her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you play on one string. She&#8217;s not the only
maid i&#8217; the world,&#8221; pouted the London beauty.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s the only one for me,&#8221; I said stubbornly, and
then added dejectedly, &#8220;and she&#8217;s not for me
neither.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little rogue began to laugh. &#8220;I give you up,
Kenn. Y&#8217;are as moonstruck a lover as ever I saw.
Here&#8217;s for a word of comfort, which you don&#8217;t deserve
at all. For a week she will be a thunder-cloud,
then the sun will beam more brightly than ever. But
don&#8217;t you be too submissive. La! Women cannot
endure a wheedling lover.&#8221;</p>
<p>After that bit of advice my sage little monitor fell
sober and explained to me her reason for sending me
the note. It appeared that Sir Robert Volney was
due to meet the party at the inn that very evening,
and Miss Westerleigh was of opinion that I and my
charge would do well to take the road at once. I was
of that mind myself. I lost no time in reaching the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
house and ordering a relay of horses for our immediate
travel. Then I took the stairs three at a time and
came knocking at Aileen&#8217;s door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who iss there?&#8221; asked a small voice, full of tears
and muffled in a pillow.</p>
<p>Her distress went to my heart, none the less because
I who had been the cause of it could not heal it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tis I&mdash;Kenneth Montagu. Open the door,
please.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence, then&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not wishing to see Mr. Montagu to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for the world would I trouble you, Miss Macleod,
but there is a matter I have to disclose that
touches us nearly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you will not have heard aright. I am desiring
to be alone, sir,&#8221; she answered, the frost in her
voice.</p>
<p>It may be guessed that this dismissal chafed me.
My eagerness was daunted, but yet I would not be
fubbed off.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Macleod, you may punish me as much as
you like some other time,&#8221; I cried desperately, &#8220;but
&#8217;fore God! if you do not open the door you will regret
it till the last day of your life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you threatening me, sir?&#8221; she asks, mighty
haughty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Threatening&mdash;no! I do not threaten, but warn.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
This matter is of life and death, not to be played
with;&#8221; and to emphasize my words I mentioned the
name of Volney.</p>
<p>She came raging to the door and whipped it open
very sudden. Her affronted eyes might have belonged
to a queen, but the stains on her cheeks
betrayed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, and what iss this important matter that cannot
be waiting? Perhaps Mr. Montagu mistakes this
for the room of Mistress Westerleigh.&#8221;</p>
<p>I told her that Sir Robert was expected shortly to
arrive at the inn, and that we must be on the road at
once. She thanked me very primly for the information,
but declared she would not trouble me further,
that she meant to abide at the inn all night no matter
who came; moreover, that when she did leave Hamish
Gorm would be sufficient guard. I argued, cajoled,
warned, threatened, but she was not to be
moved. The girl took a perverse pleasure in thwarting
me, and the keener I grew the more dour grew
she. We might have disputed the point an hour had
I not come to my senses and appeared to give way.</p>
<p>Suspecting that the girl&#8217;s fears of Sir Robert would
reassert themselves when she was left to herself, I
sought her maid and easily induced the girl to propose
to her mistress a departure without my knowledge.
The suggestion worked like a charm, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
fifteen minutes later I had the pleasure of seeing the
chaise roll out of the lighted yard into the night.
Need it be said that Kenneth Montagu was ahorse
and after the coach within a few minutes.</p>
<p>All night I jogged behind them, and in the morning
rode up to the inn where they stopped for breakfast.
From Mistress Aileen I got the slightest bow in
the world as I passed to my solitary breakfast at a
neighbouring table. Within the hour they were away
again, and I after to cover the rear. Late in the day
the near wheeler fell very lame. The rest of the animals
were dead beat, and I rode to the nearest hamlet
to get another horse. The night was falling foul, very
mirk, with a rising wind, and methought the lady&#8217;s
eyes lightened when she saw me return with help to
get them out of their difficulty. She thanked me
stiffly with a very straight lip.</p>
<p>&#8220;At all events there will be no end to the obligations
I am under, Mr. Montagu. They will be piling
high as Ben Nevis,&#8221; she said, but &#8217;twould have taken
a penetrating man to have discovered any friendliness
in the voice.</p>
<p>Yet henceforth I made myself one of the party,
admitted on sufferance with a very bad grace. More
than once I tried to break through the chill conventionals
that made the staple of our conversation, but
the girl was ice to me. In the end I grew stiff as she.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
I would ride beside the coach all day with scarce a
word, wearying for a reconciliation and yet nourishing
angry pride. When speech appeared to be demanded
between us &#8217;twas of the most formal. Faith, I think
we were liker a pair of spoilt children than sensible
grown folks.</p>
<p>While we were still in the northern counties rumours
began to reach us that General Cope&#8217;s army had
been cut to pieces by the Highlanders. The stories
ran that not a single man had escaped, that the clans,
twenty thousand strong, were headed for England, that
they were burning and destroying as they advanced.
Incredible reports of all kinds sprang out of the air,
and the utmost alarm prevailed. The report of Cope&#8217;s
defeat was soon verified. We met more than one
redcoat speeding south on a foam-flecked weary steed,
and it did not need the second sight to divine that the
dispatches they carried spoke loudly of disaster fallen
and of reinforcements needed.</p>
<p>After we had crossed the border parties of foraging
Highlanders began to appear occasionally, but a word
in the Gaelic from Hamish Gorm always served as a
password for us. To make short, early in October we
reached the Scottish capital, the formal relations which
had been established between Miss Macleod and me
continuing to the end of the journey.</p>
<p>There lived in Edinburgh an unmarried aunt of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
Aileen, a Miss Flora MacBean by name, and at her
house I left the girl while I went to notify her brother
of our arrival. I found him lodged in High Street
near the old Flesh-market Close. Malcolm Macleod
was a fine manly fellow of about three and thirty,
lusty and well-proportioned, very tanned and ruddy.
He had a quick lively eye and a firm good-humoured
mouth. In brief, he was the very picture of a frank
open-hearted Highland gentleman, and in the gay
Macleod tartan looked as gallant a figure of a soldier
as one would wish to see. He greeted me with
charming friendliness and expressed himself as deeply
gratified for my care of his sister, offering again and
again to put himself at my service in any way I might
desire.</p>
<p>We walked down the street together, and more
than once a shot plumped at our feet, for the city was
under fire from the Hanoverian garrison at the castle.
Everywhere the clansmen were in evidence. Barefooted
and barelegged Celts strutted about the city
with their bonnets scrugged low on their heads, the
hair hanging wild over their eyes and the matted
beards covering their faces. For the most part they
were very ragged, and tanned exceedingly wherever
the flesh took a peep through their outworn plaids.
They ran about the streets in groups, looking in shop
windows like children and talking their outlandish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
gibberish; then presently their Highland pride would
assert itself at the smile of some chance passer and
would send them swinging proudly off as though they
had better things at home.</p>
<p>Out of a tobacco shop came Captain Donald Roy
singing blithely,</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;&#8216;Will ye play me fair,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Highland laddie, Highland laddie?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>He was of course in the full Macdonald tartan regimentals&mdash;checkered
kilt, sporran, plaid, a brace of
pistols, a dirk in his stocking, and claymore. At
sight of me his face lighted and he came running forward
with both hands outstretched.</p>
<p>&#8220;And is it you at last, Kenn? Man, but I&#8217;ve been
wearying for a sight of your honest face. I was whiles
thinking you must have given us the go-by. Fegs,
but it&#8217;s a braw day and a sight guid for sair een to see
you, lad. You will have heard how we gave Johnnie
Cope his kail through his reek.&#8221; He broke off to
hum:&mdash;</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;&#8216;Now Johnnie, troth, ye werena blate, to come wi&#8217; the news o&#8217; your ain,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>And leave your men in sic a strait, so early in the morning.&#8217;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;And did you bring my kinswoman back safe with you?
I&#8217;se wad ye found the journey no&#8217; ower lang;&#8221; and
he cocked a merry eye at me.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<p>I flushed, and introduced him to Major Macleod,
who took occasion to thank him for his services to his
sister. They fell into a liking for each other at once.
When the major was called aside by one of his gillies
a moment later, Macdonald expressed his trust of the
other in the old Scotch saying,</p>
<p>&#8220;Yon&#8217;s a man to ride the water wi&#8217;, Kenneth.&#8221;</p>
<p>A curious sight illustrative of the Highland way of
&#8220;lifting&#8221; what took their fancy occurred as we were
all three walking toward the house of Macleod&#8217;s aunt.
Three shag-headed gillies in the tattered Cameron tartan
dragged an innkeeper from his taproom and set
him down squat on the causeway. Without even a
by-your-leave they took from his feet a pair of new
shoes with silver buckles. He protested that he was
a loyal Jacobite.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sae muckle ta better. She&#8217;ll no&#8217; grumble to
shange a progue for the Prince&#8217;s guid,&#8221; one of the
caterans answered cheerfully by way of comfort.</p>
<p>To my surprise the two Highland gentlemen
watched this high-handed proceeding with much
amusement, enjoying not a little the ridiculous figure
cut by the frightened, sputtering host. I asked them
if they were not going to interfere.</p>
<p>&#8220;What for would we do that at all events?&#8221; asked
the Macdonald. &#8220;Man, Montagu, but you whiles
have unco queer notions for so wise a lad. It&#8217;s as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
natural for a Hielander to despoil a Southron as for a
goose to gang barefit. What would Lochiel think
gin we fashed wi&#8217; his clansmen at their ploy? Na,
na! I wad be sweir to be sae upsitten (impertinent).
It wadna be tellin&#8217; a Macdonald, I&#8217;m
thinkin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aileen was so prettily glad to see her brother and
so friendly with Donald Roy, so full of gay chatter
and eager reminiscence, that I felt myself quite dashed
by the note of reserve which crept into her voice and
her manner whenever she found it incumbent to speak
to me. Her laugh would be ringing clear as the echo
of steel in frost, and when Donald lugged me into the
talk she would fall mim as a schoolgirl under the eye
of her governess. Faith, you would have thought me
her dearest enemy, instead of the man that had risked
life for her more than once. Here is a pretty gratitude,
I would say to myself in a rage, hugging my
anger with the baby thought that she would some day
scourge herself for this after I were killed in battle.
Here is a fine return for loyal service rendered, and
the front of my offending is nothing more than the
saluting an old playmate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Man, Kenneth, but you hae played the cuddie
brawly,&#8221; was Donald&#8217;s comforting remark to me after
we had left. &#8220;You maun hae made an awfu&#8217; bauchle
of it. When last I saw the lady she hoisted a fine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
colour when I daffed about you, and now she glowers
at you in a no&#8217; just friendly way.&#8221;</p>
<p>I admitted sadly that &#8217;twas so and told him the
reason, for Donald Roy had a wide observation of life
and a varied experience with the sex that made him a
valuable counsellor. The situation amused him hugely,
but what he could find of humour in it was more than
I could see.</p>
<p>&#8220;Deil hae&#8217;t, but yon quean Antoinette will be a
geyan ettercap (madcap). Tony Creagh has been
telling me about her; he&#8217;s just a wee thingie touched
there himsel&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; I interrupted a little stiffly, &#8220;but I
think I did not give the name of the lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Highlander looked at me dryly with a pawky
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hoots, man! I ken that fine, but I&#8217;m no a fule.
You named over the party and I picked the lady that
suited the speceefications.&#8221; Then he began to
chuckle: &#8220;I wad hae liked dooms weel to hae seen
you stravaiging (wandering) through the grosset
(gooseberry) bushes after the lass.&#8221;</p>
<p>I told him huffily that if that was all he could say I
had better have kept the story to myself. I had come
for advice, not to be laughed at. Donald flashed his
winsome smile and linked an arm in mine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, and here&#8217;s advice for you, man. Jouk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
(duck) and let the jaw (wave) go by. Gin it were me
the colder she were the better I wad like it. Dinna
you see that the lass rages because she likes you fine;
and since she&#8217;s a Hieland maid brought up under the
blue lift she hasna learnt to hate and smile in the same
breath.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I make neither head nor tail of your riddles,&#8221; I
told him impatiently. &#8220;By your way of it so far as I
can make out she both likes and hates me. Now
how can that be?&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Macdonald&#8217;s droll eye appeared to pity
me. &#8220;Kenneth, bairn, but you&#8217;re an awfu&#8217; ignoramus.
You ken naething ava about the lassies.
I&#8217;m wondering what they learnt you at Oxford. Gin
it&#8217;s the same to you we&#8217;ll talk of something mair
within your comprehension.&#8221; And thereupon he diverted
the conversation to the impending invasion of
England by the Highland army. Presently I asked
him what he thought of the Prince now that he had
been given a chance to study the Young Chevalier at
closer range, and I shall never forget the eager Highlander&#8217;s
enthusiastic answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the head to the heel of him he is a son of
Kings, kind-hearted, gallant, modest. He takes all
hearts by storm. Our Highland laddie is the bravest
man I ever saw, not to be rash, and the most cautious,
not to be a coward. But you will be judging for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
yourself when you are presented at the ball on
Tuesday.&#8221;</p>
<p>I told him that as yet I had no invitation to the
ball.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy seen to. The Chevalier O&#8217;Sullivan
makes out the list. I&#8217;ll drop a flea in his lug (ear).&#8221;</p>
<p>Next day was Sunday, and I arrayed myself with
great care to attend the church at which one Macvicar
preached; to be frank I didn&#8217;t care a flip of my
fingers what the doctrine was he preached; but I had
adroitly wormed out of Miss MacBean that he was
the pastor under whom she sat. Creagh called on
me before I had set out, and I dragged him with me,
he protesting much at my unwonted devotion.</p>
<p>I dare say he understood it better when he saw my
eyes glued to the pew where Miss Aileen sat with her
aunt in devout attention. What the sermon was to
have been about we never knew, on account of an
interruption which prevented us from hearing it.
During the long prayer I was comfortably watching
the back of Aileen&#8217;s head and the quarter profile of
her face when Creagh nudged me. I turned to find
him looking at me out of a very comical face, and
this was the reason for it. The hardy Macvicar was
praying for the Hanoverians and their cause.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless the King,&#8221; he was saying boldly. &#8220;Thou
knows what King I mean&mdash; May the crown sit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
easy on his head for lang. And for the young man that
is come among us to seek an earthly crown, we beseech
Thee in mercy to take him to Thyself, and give him a
crown of glory.&#8221;</p>
<p>One could have heard a pin fall in the hush, and
then the tense rustle that swept over the church and
drowned the steady low voice that never faltered in
the prayer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Egad, there&#8217;s a hit for the Prince straight from
the shoulder,&#8221; chuckled the Irishman by my side.
&#8220;Faith, the Jacks are leaving the church to the
Whigs. There goes the Major, Miss Macleod, and
her aunt.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was right. The prayer had ended and the
Macleod party were sailing down the aisle. Others
followed suit, and presently we joined the stream that
poured out of the building to show their disapproval.
&#8217;Tis an ill wind that blows nobody good. Miss MacBean
invited Creagh and me to join them in dinner,
and methought that my goddess of disdain was the
least thing warmer to me than she had been in weeks.
For the rest of the day I trod on air.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>CHARLES EDWARD STUART</h3>
</div>

<p>A beautifully engrossed invitation to
the Prince&#8217;s ball having duly arrived from his
Secretary the Chevalier O&#8217;Sullivan, I ask you
to believe that my toilet Tuesday evening was even
more a work of art than that of Sunday. In huge
disorder scarfs, lace cravats, muffs, and other necessary
equipment were littered about the room. I much
missed the neat touch of my valet Simpkins, and the
gillie Hamish Gorm, whom Major Macleod had put
at my service, did not supply his place by a deal,
since he knew no more of patching the face or powdering
a periwig than he had arrived at by the light
of nature. But despite this handicap I made shift to
do myself justice before I set off for the lodgings of
Lord Balmerino, by whom I was to be presented.</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas long since the Scottish capital had been so
gay as now, for a part of the policy of the Young
Chevalier was to wear a brave front before the world.
He and his few thousand Highlanders were pledged to
a desperate undertaking, but it was essential that the
waverers must not be allowed to suspect how slender
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
were the chances of success. One might have thought
from the splendour of his court and from the serene
confidence exhibited by the Prince and his chiefs that
the Stuarts were already in peaceable possession of
the entire dominions of their ancestors. A vast concourse
of well-dressed people thronged to Holyrood
House from morning till night to present their respects
to Prince Charles Edward. His politeness and
affability, as well as the charms of his conversation
and the graces of his person, swept the ladies especially
from their lukewarm allegiance to the Hanoverians.
They would own no lover who did not don the
white cockade of Jacobitism. They would hesitate at
no sacrifice to advance the cause of this romantic
young gambler who used swords for dice. All this
my three days residence in the city had taught me. I
was now to learn whether a personal meeting with
him would inspire me too with the ardent devotion
that animated my friends.</p>
<p>A mixed assembly we found gathered in the picture
gallery of Holyrood House. Here were French and
Irish adventurers, Highland chiefs and Lowland gentlemen,
all emulating each other in loyalty to the
ladies who had gathered from all over Scotland to
dance beneath the banner of the white rose. The
Hall was a great blaze of moving colour, but above
the tartans and the plaids, the mixed reds, greens,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
blues, and yellows, everywhere fluttered rampant the
white streamers and cockades of the Stuarts.</p>
<p>No doubt there were here sober hearts, full of anxious
portent for the future, but on the surface at least
was naught but merriment. The gayest abandon
prevailed. Strathspey and reel and Highland fling
alternated with the graceful dances of France and the
rollicking jigs of Ireland. Plainly this was no state
ceremonial, rather an international frolic to tune all
hearts to a common glee. We were on the top of
fortune&#8217;s wave. Had we not won for the Young
Chevalier by the sword the ancient capital of his
family, and did not the road to London invite us
southward? The pipers of each clan in turn dirled
out triumphant marches, and my heart began to beat
in faster time. Water must have filled the veins of a
man who could stand unmoved such contagious enthusiasm.
For me, I confess it, a climax came a moment
later that made my eyes swim.</p>
<p>Balmerino was talking with Malcolm Macleod and
James Hepburn of Keith, a model of manly simplicity
and honour who had been &#8220;out&#8221; in the &#8217;15; and as
usual their talk fell on our enterprise and its gallant
young leader. Keith narrated a story of how the
Young Chevalier, after a long day&#8217;s march on foot,
had led the army three miles out of its way in order
to avoid disturbing the wife of a cottar who had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
fallen asleep at the critical stage of a severe illness.
Balmerino capped it with another anecdote of his dismounting
from his horse after the battle of Gladsmuir
to give water and attendance to a wounded English
soldier of Cope&#8217;s army.</p>
<p>Macleod smiled, eyes sparkling. &#8220;He iss every
inch the true prince. He can tramp the hills with a
Highlander all day and never weary, he can sleep on
pease-straw as well as on a bed of down, can sup on
brose in five minutes, and win a battle in four. Oh,
yes, he will be the King for Malcolm Macleod.&#8221;</p>
<p>While he was still speaking there fell over the assembly
a sudden stillness. The word was passed from
lips to lips, &#8220;The Prince comes.&#8221; Every eye swept
to the doorway. Men bowed deep and women curtsied
low. A young man was entering slowly on the
arm of Lord George Murray.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Prince!&#8221; whispered Balmerino to me.</p>
<p>The pipes crashed out a measure of &#8220;Wha&#8217;ll be
King but Charlie?&#8221; then fell into quiet sudden as
they had begun. &#8220;Dhia theasirg an Righ!&#8221; (God
save the King) cried a splendid young Highland chief
in a voice that echoed through the hall.</p>
<p>Clanranald&#8217;s cry was lifted to the rafters by a hundred
throats. A hundred claymores leaped to air, and
while the skirling bagpipes pealed forth, &#8220;The King
shall enjoy his own again,&#8221; Charles Stuart beneath
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
an arch of shining steel trod slowly down the hall to a
dais where his fathers had sat before him.</p>
<p>If the hearts of the ladies had surrendered at discretion,
faith! we of the other sex were not much
tardier. The lad was every inch a prince. His after
life did not fulfil the promise of his youth, but at this
time he was one to see, and once having seen, to love.
All the great charm of his race found expression in
him. Gallant, gracious, generous, tender-hearted in
victory and cheerful in defeat (as we had soon to
learn, alas!), even his enemies confessed this young
Stuart a worthy leader of men. Usually suffused with
a gentle pensiveness not unbecoming, the ardour of his
welcome had given him on this occasion the martial
bearing of a heroic young Achilles. With flushed
cheek and sparkling eye he ascended the dais.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ladies, gentlemen, my loyal Highlanders, friends
all, the tongue of Charles Stuart has no words to tell
the warm message of his heart. Unfriended and alone
he came among you, resolved with the help of good
swords to win back that throne on which a usurper
sits, or failing in that to perish in the attempt. How
nobly you our people have rallied to our side in this
undertaking to restore the ancient liberties of the
kingdom needs not be told. To the arbitrament of
battle and to the will of God we confidently appeal,
and on our part we pledge our sacred honour neither to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
falter nor to withdraw till this our purpose is accomplished.
To this great task we stand plighted, so
help us God and the right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Tis impossible to conceive the effect of these few
simple sentences. Again the pipes voiced our dumb
emotion in that stirring song,</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;We&#8217;ll owre the water and owre the sea,</p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>And live and die wi&#8217; Charlie.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The mighty cheer broke forth again and seemed to
rock the palace, but deeper than all cheering was the
feeling that found expression in long-drawn breath and
broken sob and glimmering tear. The gallant lad had
trusted us, had put his life in our keeping; we highly
resolved to prove worthy of that trust.</p>
<p>At a signal from the Prince the musicians struck up
again the dance, and bright eyes bedimmed with tears
began to smile once more. With a whispered word
Balmerino left me and made his way to the side of the
Prince, about whom were grouped the Duke of Perth,
Lord Lewis Gordon, Lord Elcho, the ill-fated Kilmarnock,
as well as Lochiel, Cluny, Macleod, Clanranald,
and other Highland gentlemen who had taken their fortune
in their hands at the call of this young adventurer
with the enchanting smile. To see him was to understand
the madness of devotion that had carried away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
these wise gray-haired gentlemen, but to those who
never saw him I despair of conveying in cold type the
subtle quality of charm that radiated from him. In the
very bloom of youth, tall, slender, and handsome, he
had a grace of manner not to be resisted. To condescend
to the particulars of his person: a face of perfect
oval very regular in feature; large light blue eyes
shaded by beautifully arched brows; nose good and of
the Roman type; complexion fair, mouth something
small and effeminate, forehead high and full. He was
possessed of the inimitable reserve and bearing that
mark the royal-born, and that despite his genial frankness.
On this occasion he wore his usual light-coloured
peruke with the natural hair combed over the front, a
tartan short coat on the breast of which shone the star
of the order of St. Andrews, red velvet small-clothes,
and a silver-hilted rapier. The plaid he ordinarily
carried had been doffed for a blue sash wrought with
gold.</p>
<p>All this I had time to note before Lord Balmerino
rejoined me and led me forward to the presentation.
The Prince separated himself from the group about
him and came lightly down the steps to meet me. I
fell on my knee and kissed his hand, but the Prince,
drawing me to my feet, embraced me.</p>
<p>&#8220;My gallant Montagu,&#8221; he cried warmly. &#8220;Like
father, like son. God knows I welcome you, both on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
your own account and because you are one of the first
English gentlemen to offer his sword to the cause of
his King.&#8221;</p>
<p>I murmured that my sword would be at his service
till death. To put me at my ease he began to question
me about the state of public feeling in England
concerning the enterprise. What information I had
was put at his disposal, and I observed that his grasp
of the situation appeared to be clear and incisive. He
introduced me to the noblemen and chiefs about him,
and I was wise enough to know that if they made
much of me it was rather for the class I was supposed
to represent than for my own poor merits.
Presently I fell back to make way for another gentleman
about to be presented. Captain Macdonald
made his way to me and offered a frank hand in congratulation.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Fore God, Montagu, you have leaped gey sudden
into favour. Deil hae&#8217;t, Red Donald brought with
him a hundred claymores and he wasna half so kenspeckle
(conspicuous). I&#8217;ll wad your fortune&#8217;s made,
for you hae leaped in heels ower hurdies,&#8221; he told me
warmly.</p>
<p>From affairs of state to those of the heart may be a
long cast, but the mind of one-and-twenty takes it at
a bound. My eye went questing, fell on many a blushing
maid and beaming matron, at last singled out my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
heart&#8217;s desire. She was teaching a Highland dance to
a graceful cavalier in white silk breeches, flowered
satin waistcoat, and most choicely powdered periwig,
fresh from the friseur. His dainty muff and exquisite
clouded cane depended from a silken loop to proclaim
him the man of fashion. Something characteristic in
his easy manner, though I saw but his back, chilled
me to an indefinable premonition of his identity. Yet
an instant, and a turn in the dance figure flung into
view the face of Sir Robert Volney, negligent and unperturbed,
heedless apparently of the fact that any
moment a hand might fall on his shoulder to lead him
to his death. Aileen, to the contrary, clearly showed
fear, anxiety, a troubled mind&mdash;to be detected in the
hurried little glances of fearfulness directed toward
her brother Malcolm, and in her plain eagerness to
have done with the measure. She seemed to implore
the baronet to depart, and Volney smilingly negatived
her appeal. The girl&#8217;s affronted eyes dared him to
believe that she danced with him for any other reason
than because he had staked his life to see her again
and she would not have his death at her door. Disdain
of her own weakness and contempt of him were
eloquent in every movement of the lissom figure.
&#8217;Twas easy to be seen that the man was working on
her fears for him, in order to obtain another foothold
with her. I resolved to baulk his scheme.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>While I was still making my way toward them
through the throng they disappeared from the assembly
hall. A still hunt of five minutes, and I had
run down my prey in a snug little reception-room of
a size to fit two comfortably. The girl fronted him
scornfully, eyes flaming.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coward, you play on a girl&#8217;s fears, you take advantage
of her soft heart to force yourself on her,&#8221; she
was telling him in a low, bitter voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I risk my life to see the woman that I love,&#8221; he
answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;My grief! Love! What will such a thing as you
be knowing of love?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man winced. On my soul I believe that at last
he was an honest lover. His beautiful, speaking eyes
looked straight into hers. His mannerisms had for
the moment been sponged out. Straight from the
heart he spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have learnt, Aileen. My hunger for a sight of
you has starved my folly and fed my love. Believe
me, I am a changed man.&#8221;</p>
<p>The play and curve of her lips stung him. He
flung himself desperately into his mad love-making.
&#8220;&#8216;Belle Marquise, vos beaux yeux me font mourir
d&#8217;amour,&#8217;&#8221; he quoted from Moliere. &#8220;&#8217;Tis true,
Aileen; I die of love; it burns me up,&#8221; he added passionately,
hungry eyes devouring the flying colours of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
her cheek, the mass of rippling hair, the fresh, sweet,
subtle fragrance of her presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to hurry about it then, for on my soul
you&#8217;re due to die of tightened hemp to-morrow,&#8221; I
told him, lounging forward from the door.</p>
<p>The girl cried out, eyes dilating, hand pressing to
the heart. For the man, after the first start he did
not turn a hair. The face that looked over his
shoulder at me was unmoved and bereft of emotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;My malapropos friend Montagu again. Devil take
it, you have an awkward way of playing harlequin
when you&#8217;re not wanted! Now to come blundering
in upon a lady and her friend is&mdash; Well, not the
best of form. Better drop it before it becomes a
habit,&#8221; he advised.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Slife, &#8217;tis tit for tat! I learnt it from you,&#8221; was
my answer.</p>
<p>Long we looked at each other, preparing for the
battle that was to come. Save for the quick breathing
of the girl no sound fell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir Robert, your audacity confounds all precedent,&#8221;
I said at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;You flatter me, Mr. Montagu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Believe me, had Major Macleod discovered you
instead of me your soul had by this time been speeding
hellward.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exit Flattery,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;The lady phrased
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
it less vilely. Heavenward, she put it! &#8217;Twould be
interesting to know which of you is right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As you say, an interesting topic of speculation,
and one you&#8217;re like to find the answer of shortly, presupposing
that you suffer the usual fate of captured
spies.&#8221;</p>
<p>His brows lifted in polite inquiry. &#8220;Indeed! A
spy?&#8221; he asked, indifferently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not? The favourite of the Hanoverian
usurpers discovered in our midst&mdash;what other explanation
will it bear?&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled. &#8220;Perhaps I have a mind to join your
barelegged rebellion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid your services are not available, Sir Robert.
Three hundred Macleod claymores bar the way, all
eager to wipe out an insult to the daughter of
Raasay. Faith, when they have settled their little account
against you there won&#8217;t be much left for the
Prince.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! Then for the sake of argument suppose we
put it that I&#8217;m visiting this delightful city for my
health.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will find the climate not agree with you, I
fear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then say for pleasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twill prove more exciting than amusing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On my life, dear Kenn, &#8217;tis both.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I have but to raise my voice and you are undone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His voice was ever soft, gentle, and low, an excellent
thing in Kenneth,&#8221; he parodied, laughing
at me.</p>
<p>The girl said never a word, but her level eyes
watched me steadily. No need of words to tell me
that I was on trial! But I would not desist.</p>
<p>&#8220;You appear not to realize the situation,&#8221; I told
him coldly. &#8220;Your life is in hazard.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man yawned in my face. &#8220;Not at all, I sit
here as safe as if I were at White&#8217;s, and a devilish
deal better satisfied. Situation piquant! Company
of the best! Gad&#8217;s life, I cry content.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we talk at cross purposes. I am trying to
have you understand that your position is critical, Sir
Robert.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nonchalant yet watchful, indolent and yet alert,
gracefully graceless, he watched me smilingly out of
half-closed eyes; and then quietly fired the shot that
brought me to.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you were not a gentleman, Montagu, the situation
would be vastly different.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not see the point,&#8221; I told him; but I did, and
raged at it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you do. Your lips are sealed. I am your
rival&#8221;&mdash;he bowed to Aileen&mdash;&#8220;for the favour of a
lady. If you put me out of the way by playing informer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
what appearance will it bear? You may talk
of duty till the world ends, but you will be a marked
man, despised by all&mdash;and most of all by Kenneth
Montagu.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man was right. At one sweep he had spiked
my guns, demolished my defenses. The triumph was
sponged from my face. I fumed in a stress of impotence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that. I shall have to think
of it. There is a duty to perform,&#8221; I said at last,
lamely.</p>
<p>He waved a hand airily. &#8220;My dear fellow, think
as long as you please. You can&#8217;t think away facts.
Egad, they&#8217;re immutable. You know me to be no
spy. Conceded that I am in a false position. What
can you do about it? You can&#8217;t in honour give me
up. I&#8217;faith, you&#8217;re handcuffed to inaction.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was, but my temper was not improved at hearing
him tell it me so suavely and so blandly. He sat
smiling and triumphant, chuckling no doubt at the
dilemma into which he had thrust me. The worst of
it was that while I was ostensibly master of the situation
he had me at his mercy. I was a helpless victor
without any of the fruits of victory.</p>
<p>&#8220;You took advantage of a girl&#8217;s soft heart to put
her in a position that was indefensible,&#8221; I told him
with bitter bluntness. &#8220;Save this of throwing yourself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
on her mercy there was no other way of approaching
her. Of the wisdom of the serpent you have no
lack. I congratulate you, Sir Robert. But one may
be permitted to doubt the manliness of such a course.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pipers struck up a song that was the vogue
among our party, and a young man passed the entrance
of the room singing it.</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>

<p>he hummed softly in his clipped English tongue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pity you won&#8217;t live to see it,&#8221; I retorted tartly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re still nursing that maggot, are you? Debating
with yourself about giving me up, eh? Well
that&#8217;s a matter you must settle with your conscience,
if you indulge in the luxury of one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You would never give him up, Kenneth,&#8221; said
Aileen in a low voice. &#8220;Surely you would not be
doing that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not let him stay here. You may be sure
of that,&#8221; I said doggedly.</p>
<p>The girl ventured a suggestion timidly. &#8220;Perhaps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
Sir Robert will be leaving to-morrow&mdash;for London
mayhap.&#8221;</p>
<p>Volney shook his head decisively. &#8220;Not I. Why,
I have but just arrived. Besides, here is a problem
in ethics for Mr. Montagu to solve. Strength comes
through conflict, so the schools teach. Far be it from
me to remove the cause of doubt. Let him solve his
problem for himself, egad!&#8221;</p>
<p>He seemed to find a feline pleasure in seeing how
far he could taunt me to go. He held me on the
knife-edge of irritation, and perillous as was the experiment
he enjoyed seeing whether he could not drive
me to give him up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Macleod&#8217;s solution falls pat. Better leave to-morrow,
Sir Robert. To stay is dangerous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to drink;
but I tell you, my lord fool, &#8216;out of this nettle danger,
we pluck this flower safety,&#8217;&#8221; he quoted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you always have your tag of Shakespeare
ready; then let me remind you what he has to say
about the better part of valour,&#8221; I flung back, for once
alert in riposte.</p>
<p>&#8220;A hit, and from the same play,&#8221; he laughed.
&#8220;But a retreat&mdash; &#8217;Tis not to be thought of. No,
no, Montagu! And it must be you&#8217;ll just have to give
me up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you harp on that! You may say it once too
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
often. I shall find a way to get rid of you,&#8221; I answered
blackly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me find it for you, lad,&#8221; said a voice from the
doorway.</p>
<p>We turned, to find that Donald Roy had joined the
party. He must have been standing there unobserved
long enough to understand my dilemma, for he shot
straight to the mark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir Robert, I&#8217;ll never be denying that you&#8217;re a
bold villain, and that is the one thing that will be saving
your life this night. I&#8217;m no&#8217; here to argie-bargie
with you. The plain fact is just this; that I dinna
care a rap for you the tane gate or the tither (the one
way or the other). I&#8217;d like fine to see you dancing
frae the widdie (gallows), but gin the lady wants you
spared I&#8217;ll no&#8217; say her no. Mr. Englisher, you&#8217;ll just
gie me your word to tak the road for the border this
night, or I&#8217;ll give a bit call to Major Macleod. I
wouldna wonder but he wad be blithe to see you. Is
it to be the road or the Macleod?&#8221;</p>
<p>I could have kissed the honest trusty face of the
man, for he had lifted me out of a bog of unease. I
might be bound by honour, but Captain Macdonald
was free as air to dictate terms. Volney looked long
at him, weighed the man, and in the end flung up the
sponge. He rose to his feet and sauntered over to
Aileen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am desolated to find that urgent business takes
me south at once, Miss Macleod. &#8217;Tis a matter of the
gravest calls me; nothing of less importance than the
life of my nearest friend would take me from you.
But I&#8217;m afraid it must be &#8216;Au revoir&#8217; for the present,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>She looked past the man as if he had not existed.</p>
<p>He bowed low, the flattery of deference in his fine
eyes, which knew so well how to be at once both bold
and timid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgiven my madness?&#8221; he murmured.</p>
<p>Having nothing to say, she still said it eloquently.
Volney bowed himself out of the room, nodded carelessly
to me as he passed, touched Macdonald on the
arm with a pleasant promise to attend the obsequies
when the Highlander should be brought to London
for his hanging, lounged elegantly through the crowded
assembly hall, and disappeared into the night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>BLUE BONNETS ARE OVER THE BORDER</h3>
</div>

<p>Next day I enrolled myself as a gentleman
volunteer in Lord Balmerino&#8217;s troop of
horse-guards, and was at once appointed to
a lieutenancy. In waiting for reinforcements and in
making preparations for the invasion three weeks
were lost, but at last, on the 31st of October, came
the order for the march. We had that day been
joined by Cluny Macpherson at the head of his
clan Pherson, by Menzies of Shien, and by several
other small bodies of Highlanders. All told our
force amounted to less than five thousand men, but
the rapidity of our movements and the impetuous
gallantry of the clansmen made the enterprise less
mad than it appeared upon the face of it. Moreover
we expected to be largely reinforced by recruits who
were to declare themselves as we marched south.</p>
<p>It may be guessed that the last hour of leisure I
had in the city was spent with Aileen. Of that hour
the greater part of it was worse than lost, for a thickheaded,
long-legged oaf of an Ayrshire laird shared
the room with us and hung to his chair with dogged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
persistency the while my imagination rioted in diverse
forms of sudden death for him. Nor did it
lessen my impatience to know that the girl was
laughing in her sleeve at my restlessness. She took a
malicious pleasure in drawing out her hobnailed admirer
on the interesting subject of sheep-rot. At
last, having tormented me to the limit of prudence,
she got rid of him. To say truth, Miss Aileen had
for weeks held me on the tenter-hooks of doubt, now
in high hope, far more often in black despair. She
had become very popular with the young men who
had declared in favour of the exiled family, and I never
called without finding some colour-splashed Gael or
broad-tongued Lowland laird in dalliance. &#8217;Twas impossible
to get a word with her alone. Her admirers
were forever shutting off the sunlight from me.</p>
<p>Aileen was sewing on a white satin cockade, which
the man from Ayrshire, in the intervals between the
paragraphs of his lecture on the sheep industry, had
been extremely solicitous of obtaining for a favour.
&#8217;Twas a satisfaction to me that my rustic friend departed
without it. He was no sooner gone than I
came near and perched myself on the arm of a chair
beside the girl. For a minute I sat watching in
silence the deft movements of the firm brown hands
in which were both delicacy and power.</p>
<p>Then, &#8220;For Malcolm?&#8221; I asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No-o.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For whom then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For a brave gentleman who iss marching south
with the Prince&mdash;a kind friend of mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to have many of them. For which one
is the favour?&#8221; I queried, a little bitterly.</p>
<p>She looked at me askance, demure yet whimsical.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will can tell when you see him wearing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I fell sulky, at the which mirth bubbled up in her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he as good a friend as I am, this fine lover of
yours?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every whit.&#8221; Mockery of my sullenness danced
in her blue eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;And do you&mdash;like him as well?&#8221; I blurted out,
face flaming.</p>
<p>She nodded yes, gaily, without the least sentiment
in the world.</p>
<p>I flung away in a pet. &#8220;You&#8217;re always laughing
at me. By Heaven, I won&#8217;t be made a fool of by any
girl!&#8221;</p>
<p>The corners of her eyes puckered to fresh laughter.
&#8220;Troth, and you needna fear, Kenneth. No girl will
can do that for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then,&#8221; I was beginning, half placated at the
apparent flattery, but stopped with a sudden divination
of her meaning. &#8220;You think me a fool already.
Is that it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I wass thinking that maybe you werena showing
the good gumption this day, Mr. Kenneth Montagu.&#8221;</p>
<p>My pride and my misery shook hands. I came
back to blurt out in boyish fashion,</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us not quarrel again to-day, Aileen, and&mdash;do
not laugh at me these last few minutes. We
march this afternoon. The order has been given out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her hands dropped to her lap. Save where a spot
of faint red burned in either cheek the colour ran out
of her face. I drove my news home, playing for a
sign of her love, desiring to reach the spring of her tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of us will never cross the border twice,&#8221; I
said.</p>
<p>My news had flung a shadow across the bright
track of her gayety. &#8217;Tis one thing for a high-spirited
woman to buckle on the sword of her friend;
&#8217;tis another to see him go out to the fight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us not be thinking of that at all, Kenneth,&#8221;
she cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not? &#8217;Tis a fact to face,&#8221; I insisted cruelly.
&#8220;There&#8217;ll be many a merry lusty gentleman lying
quiet under the sod, Aileen, before we reach London
town. From the ownership of broad moorland and
large steading they will come down to own no more
of earth than six foot by two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They will be dying as brave gentlemen should,&#8221;
she said, softly, her voice full of tears.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And if I am one of them?&#8221; I asked, making a
more home thrust.</p>
<p>The girl stood there tall, slim, pallid, head thrown
back, the pulse in the white curved throat beating
fast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh Kenneth, you will not be,&#8221; she cried piteously.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if I am?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, Kenneth?&#8221; Her low voice implored me
to desist; so too the deep billowing breasts and melting
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fighting will be sharp and our losses heavy.
It&#8217;s his death many a man is going to, Aileen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and if you will be believing me, Kenneth,
the harder part iss for those of us who cannot fight but
must wear away the long days and mirk nights at
home. At the least I am thinking so whatever. The
long live day we sit, and can do nothing but wait and
wait. After every fight will not some mother be
crooning the coronach for her dear son? Every glen
will have its wailing wife and its fatherless bairns.
And there will be the lovers too for whom there iss
the driech wait, forby (besides) that maybe their dearest
will be lying under the rowans with their een
steekit (eyes fixed) in death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some of us who have neither mother,
wife, nor lover. Will there be none to spare a tear
for us if we fall?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, and there will, but&#8221;&mdash;a wan little smile
broke through the film of gathering tears&mdash;&#8220;we will
be waiting till they are needed, and we will be praying
that the evil day may never come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hoping that myself,&#8221; I told her, smiling, &#8220;but
hope never turns aside the leaden bullet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Prayers may,&#8221; she answered quickly, the shy lids
lifting from the blue eyes bravely to meet my look,
&#8220;and you will never be wanting (lacking) mine, my
friend.&#8221; Then with the quick change of mood that
was so characteristic of her, she added: &#8220;But I will
be the poor friend, to fash (bother) you with all these
clavers (idle talk) when I should be heartening you.
You are glad to be going, are you not?&#8221;</p>
<p>All the romance and uplift of our cause thrilled
through me.</p>
<p>&#8220;By God, yes! When my King calls I go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes shone on me, tender, wistful, proud.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s the true word, Kenneth. It goes to
the heart of your friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To hear you say that rewards me a hundred times,
dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>I rose to go. She asked, &#8220;Must you be leaving already?&#8221;</p>
<p>When I told her &#8220;Yes!&#8221; she came forward and
shyly pinned the cockade on the lapel of my coat. I
drew a deep breath and spoke from a husky throat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>&#8220;God bless you for that, Aileen girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was in two minds then about taking her in my
arms and crying out that I loved her, but I remembered
that I had made compact with myself not to
speak till the campaign was ended and the Prince
seated as regent on his father&#8217;s throne. With a full
heart I wrung her hand in silence and turned away.</p>
<p>Prince Charles and his life-guards, at the head of
the army, moved from Holyrood to Pinkie-house that
afternoon. A vast concourse of people were gathered
to cheer us on our way, as we passed through the
streets to the sound of the pipes and fife and beating
drum. More than one twisted cripple flung himself
before the horse of the Prince, begging for &#8220;the King&#8217;s
touch.&#8221; In each case the Young Chevalier disclaimed
any power of healing, but his kindly heart forbade his
denying the piteous appeal. With a slight smile of
sympathy he would comply with the request, saying,
&#8220;I touch, but God heal.&#8221; At the head of each clan-regiment
rode its chief, and in front of every company
the captains, lieutenants, and ensigns, all of
whom were gentlemen of the clan related by blood
ties to the chief. Though I say it who was one of
them, never a more devoted little army went out on a
madder or more daring enterprise.</p>
<p>Just one more glimpse of Aileen I got to carry with
me through weary months of desire. From the window
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
of her aunt&#8217;s house she was waving a tartan
scarf, and many a rugged kerne&#8217;s face lighted at the
girl&#8217;s eager loyalty. Flushed with shy daring, the
soft pliant curves of her figure all youth and grace,
my love&#8217;s picture framed in the casement was an unconscious
magnet for all eyes. The Prince smiled
and bowed to her, then said something which I did
not catch to Creagh who was riding beside him. The
Irishman laughed and looked over at me, as did also
the Prince. His Highness asked another question or
two, and presently Tony fell into narration. From
the young Stuart Prince&#8217;s curious looks at me &#8217;twas
plain to be seen that Creagh was recounting the tale
of my adventures. Once I heard the Prince exclaim,
&#8220;What! That boy?&#8221; More than once he laughed
heartily, for Creagh was an inimitable story-teller and
every point to be scored in the telling gained sparkle
from his Irish wit. When he had finished Prince
Charles sent for me and congratulated me warmly on
the boldness and the aplomb (so he was kind enough
to phrase it) which had carried me through devious
dangers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>CULLODEN</h3>
</div>

<p>I have neither space nor heart to attempt a history
of our brilliant but ill-starred campaign. Surely
no more romantic attempt to win a throne was ever
made. With some few thousand ill-armed Highlanders
and a handful of lowland recruits the Prince cut his way
through the heart of England, defeated two armies
and repulsed a third, each of them larger than his own
and far better supplied with the munitions of war,
captured Carlisle, Manchester, and other towns, even
pushed his army beyond Derby to a point little more
than a hundred miles from London. Had the gentlemen
of England who believed in our cause been possessed
of the same spirit of devotion that animated
these wild Highlanders we had unseated the Hanoverians
out of doubt, but their loyalty was not strong
enough to outweigh the prudential considerations that
held them back. Their doubts held them inactive until
too late.</p>
<p>There are some who maintain that had we pushed
on from Derby, defeated the army of the Duke of
Cumberland, of which the chance at this time was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
good, and swept on to London, that George II would
have been sent flying to his beloved Hanover. We
know now in what a state of wild excitement the capital
city was awaiting news of our approach, how the
household treasures of the Guelphs were all packed,
how there was a run on the Bank of England, how
even the Duke of Newcastle, prime minister of Great
Britain, locked himself in his chamber all day denying
admittance to all in an agony of doubt as to whether
he had better declare at once for the Stuarts. We
know too that the Wynns and other loyal Welsh gentlemen
had already set out to rally their country for the
honest cause, that cautious France was about to send
an army to our assistance.</p>
<p>But all this was knowledge too late acquired. The
great fact that confronted us was that without a French
army to assist, our English friends would not redeem
their contingent pledges. We were numerically of no
greater force than when we had set out from Scotland,
and the hazard of an advance was too great. General
Wade and the Duke of Cumberland were closing in on
us from different sides, each with an army that outnumbered
ours, and a third army was waiting for us before
London. &#8217;Tis just possible that we might have taken
the desperate chance and won, as the Prince was so
eager that we should do, but it was to be considered
that as a defeated army in a hostile country, had the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
fortune of war declared against us, we would surely
have been cut to pieces in our retreat. By Lord
George Murray and the chiefs it was judged wiser to
fall back and join Lord John Drummond&#8217;s army in
Scotland. They declared that they would follow
wherever the Prince chose to lead, but that they felt
strongly that a further advance was to doom their
clansmen to destruction. Reluctantly the Prince gave
way.</p>
<p>On the 6th of December, before daybreak, the
army began its retreat, which was conducted with
great skill by Lord George Murray. Never were men
more disappointed than the rank and file of the
army when they found that a retreat had been resolved
upon. Expressions of chagrin and disappointment
were to be heard on every hand. But the necessity
of the retreat was soon apparent to all, for the regulars
were now closing in on us from every hand. By out-marching
and out-maneuvering General Wade, we beat
him to Lancaster, but his horse were entering the town
before we had left the suburbs. At Clifton the Duke
of Cumberland, having joined forces with Wade, came
in touch with us, and his van was soundly drubbed by
our rear-guard under Lord George, who had with him
at the time the Stewarts of Appin, the Macphersons,
Colonel Stuart&#8217;s regiment, and Donald Roy&#8217;s Macdonalds.
By great good chance I arrived with a message
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
to Lord George from the Prince in time to take part
in this brilliant little affair. With his usual wisdom
Lord George had posted his men in the enclosures
and park of Lowther Hall, the Macdonalds on the
right of the highway, Colonel Stuart in close proximity,
and the Macphersons and the Appin regiment to the
left of the road. I dismounted, tied my horse, and
joined the Red Macdonald&#8217;s company where they
were lying in the shrubbery. We lay there a devil of a
while, Donald Roy smoking as contented as you please,
I in a stew of impatience and excitement; presently we
could hear firing over to the left where Cluny Macpherson
and Stewart of Ardshiel were feeling the enemy
and driving them back. At last the order came to advance.
Donald Roy leaped to his feet, waved his
sword and shouted &#8220;Claymore!&#8221; Next moment we
were rushing pell-mell down the hillside through the
thick gorse, over hedges, and across ditches. We met
the dragoons in full retreat across the moor at right
angles toward us, raked them with a cross fire, and
coming to close quarters cut them to pieces with the
sword. In this little skirmish, which lasted less than a
quarter of an hour, our loss was insignificant,
while that of the enemy reached well into the
three figures. The result of this engagement was
that our army was extricated from a precarious
position and that Cumberland allowed us henceforth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
to retreat at leisure without fear of molestation.</p>
<p>Of the good fortune which almost invariably attended
our various detachments in the North, of our
retreat to Scotland and easy victory over General
Hawley at the battle of Falkirk, and of the jealousies
and machinations of Secretary Murray and the Irish
Prince&#8217;s advisers, particularly O&#8217;Sullivan and Sir
Thomas Sheridan, against Lord George Murray and
the chiefs, I can here make no mention, but come at
once to the disastrous battle of Culloden which put a
period to our hopes. A number of unfortunate circumstances
had conspired to weaken us. According to
the Highland custom, many of the troops, seeing no
need of their immediate presence, had retired temporarily
to their homes. Several of the clan regiments
were absent on forays and other military expeditions.
The Chevalier O&#8217;Sullivan, who had charge of
the commissariat department, had from gross negligence
managed to let the army get into a state bordering on
starvation, and that though there was a quantity of
meal in Inverness sufficient for a fortnight&#8217;s consumption.
The man had allowed the army to march from
the town without provisions, and the result was that at
the time of the battle most of the troops had tasted
but a single biscuit in two days. To cap all, the men
were deadly wearied by the long night march to surprise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
the Duke of Cumberland&#8217;s army and their dejected
return to Drummossie Moor after the failure of
the attempt. Many of the men and officers slipped
away to Inverness in search of refreshments, being on
the verge of starvation; others flung themselves down
on the heath, sullen, dejected, and exhausted, to forget
their hunger for the moment in sleep.</p>
<p>Without dubiety our plain course was to have fallen
back across the Nairn among the hills and let the
Duke weary his troops trying to drag his artillery up
the mountainsides. The battle might easily have
been postponed for several days until our troops were
again rested, fed, and in good spirits. Lord George
pointed out at the counsel that a further reason for delay
lay in the fact that the Mackenzies under Lord
Cromarty, the second battalion of the Frasers under
the Master of Lovat, the Macphersons under
Cluny, the Macgregors under Glengyle, Mackinnon&#8217;s
followers, and the Glengary Macdonald&#8217;s under
Barisdale were all on the march to join us and would
arrive in the course of a day or two. That with
these reinforcements, and in the hill country, so eminently
suited to our method of warfare, we might make
sure of a complete victory, was urged by him and
others. But O&#8217;Sullivan and his friends had again obtained
the ear of the Prince and urged him to immediate
battle. This advice jumped with his own high
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
spirit, for he could not brook to fall back in the face of
the enemy awaiting the conflict. The order went
forth to gather the clans for the fight.</p>
<p>To make full the tale of his misdeeds came O&#8217;Sullivan&#8217;s
fatal slight to the pride of the Macdonalds. Since
the days of Robert the Bruce and Bannockburn it had
been their clan privilege to hold the post of honour on
the right. The blundering Irishman assigned this position
to the Athole men in forming the line of battle,
and stubbornly refused to reform his line. The Duke
of Perth, who commanded on the left wing, endeavoured
to placate the clan by vowing that they would that
day make a right of the left and promising to change
his name to Macdonald after the victory. Riding to
the Duke with a message from the Prince I chanced
on a man lying face down among the whin bushes.
For the moment I supposed him dead, till he lifted
himself to an elbow. The man turned to me a gash
face the colour of whey, and I saw that it was Donald
Roy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ohon! Ohon! The evil day hass fallen on us,
Kenneth. Five hundred years the Macdonalds have
held the post of honour. They will never fight on the
left,&#8221; he told me in bitter despair and grief. &#8220;Wae&#8217;s
me! The red death grips us. Old MacEuan who
hass the second sight saw a vision in the night of
Cumberland&#8217;s ridens driving over a field lost to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
the North. Death on the field and on the scaffold.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have never known a man of saner common sense
than Donald Roy, but when it comes to their superstitions
all Highlanders are alike. As well I might
have reasoned with a wooden post. MacEuan of the
seeing eyes had predicted disaster, and calamity was
to be our portion.</p>
<p>He joined me and walked beside my horse toward
his command. The firing was by this time
very heavy, our cannon being quite ineffective and
the artillery of the English well served and deadly.
Their guns, charged with cartouch, flung death wholesale
across the ravine at us and decimated our ranks.
The grape-shot swept through us like a hail-storm.
Galled beyond endurance by the fire of the enemy,
the clans clamoured to be led forward in the charge.
Presently through the lifting smoke we saw the devoted
Mackintoshes rushing forward against the cannon.
After them came the Maclaughlans and the
Macleans to their left, and a moment later the whole
Highland line was in motion with the exception of
the Macdonalds, who hewed the turf with their swords
in a despairing rage but would neither fight nor fly.
Their chief, brave Keppoch, stung to the quick, advanced
almost alone, courting death rather than to
survive the day&#8217;s disgrace. Captain Donald Roy followed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
at his heels, imploring his chieftain not to sacrifice
himself, but Keppoch bade him save himself.
For him, he would never see the sunrise again. Next
moment he fell to the ground from a musket-shot,
never to speak more. My last glimpse of Captain
Roy was to see him carrying back the body of his chief.</p>
<p>I rode back at a gallop along the ridge to my troop.
The valley below was a shambles. The English cannon
tore great gaps in the ranks of the advancing
Highlanders. The incessant fire of the infantry raked
them. From the left wing Major Wolfe&#8217;s regiment
poured an unceasing flank fire of musketry. The
Highlanders fell in platoons. Still they swept forward
headlong. They reached the first line of the
enemy. &#8217;Twas claymore against bayonet. Another
minute, and the Highlanders had trampled down the
regulars and were pushing on in impetuous gallantry.
The thin tartan line clambering up the opposite side
of the ravine grew thinner as the grape-shot carried
havoc to their ranks. Cobham&#8217;s and Kerr&#8217;s dragoons
flanked them <i>en potence</i>. To stand that hell of fire
was more than mortal men could endure. Scarce a
dozen clansmen reached the second line of regulars.
The rest turned and cut their way, sword in hand,
through the flanking regiments which had formed on
the ground over which they had just passed with the
intention of barring the retreat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></p>
<p>Our life-guards and the French pickets, together
with Ogilvy&#8217;s regiment, checked in some measure the
pursuit, but nothing could be done to save the day.
All was irretrievably lost, though the Prince galloped
over the field attempting a rally. The retreat became
a rout, and the rout a panic. As far as Inverness the
ground was strewn with the dead slain in that ghastly
pursuit.</p>
<p>The atrocities committed after the battle would
have been worthy of savages rather than of civilized
troops. Many of the inhabitants of Inverness had
come out to see the battle from curiosity and were
cut down by the infuriated cavalry. The carnage of
the battle appeared not to satiate their horrid thirst
for blood, and the troopers, bearing in mind their disgrace
at Gladsmuir and Falkirk, rushed to and fro
over the field massacring the wounded. I could ask
any fair-minded judge to set up against this barbarity
the gentle consideration and tenderness of Prince
Charles and his wild Highlanders in their hours of
victory. We never slew a man except in the heat of
fight, and the wounded of the enemy were always
cared for with the greatest solicitude. From this one
may conclude that the bravest troops are the most
humane. These followers of the Duke had disgraced
themselves, and they ran to an excess of cruelty in an
attempt to wipe out their cowardice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>Nor was it the soldiery alone that committed excesses.
I regret to have to record that many of the
officers also engaged in them. A party was dispatched
from Inverness the day after the battle to put
to death all the wounded they might find in the inclosures
of Culloden Park near the field of the contest.
A young Highlander serving with the English army
was afterwards heard to declare that he saw seventy-two
unfortunate victims dragged from their hiding in
the heather to hillocks and shot down by volleys of
musketry. Into a small sheep hut on the moor some
of our wounded had dragged themselves. The dragoons
secured the door and fired the hut. One instance
of singular atrocity is vouched for. Nineteen
wounded Highland officers, too badly injured to join
the retreat, secreted themselves in a small plantation
near Culloden-house, to which mansion they were
afterward taken. After being allowed to lie without
care twenty-four hours they were tossed into carts,
carried to the wall of the park, ranged against it in a
row, and instantly shot. I myself was a witness of
one incident which touches the butcher of Cumberland
nearly. If I relate the affair, &#8217;tis because it falls
pat with the narrative of my escape.</p>
<p>In the streets of Inverness I ran across Major
Macleod gathering together the remnant of his command
to check the pursuit until the Prince should
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
have escaped. The man had just come from seeing
his brave clansmen mowed down, and his face looked
like death.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Prince&mdash; Did he escape?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;I
saw him last trying to stem the tide, with Sheridan
and O&#8217;Sullivan tugging at his reins to induce a flight.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Macleod nodded. &#8220;They passed through the
town not five minutes ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked him whether he had seen anything of
Captain Roy Macdonald, and he told me that he had
last seen him lying wounded on the field. I had him
describe to me accurately the position, and rode back
by a wide circuit toward Drummossie Moor. I had
of course torn off the white cockade and put it in my
breast so as to minimize the danger of being recognized
as a follower of the Prince. My heart goes to
my throat whenever I think of that ride, for behind
every clump of whins one might look to find a
wounded clansman hiding from the riders of Cumberland.
By good providence I came on Captain Macdonald
just as three hussars were about to make an
end of him. He had his back to a great stone, and
was waiting grimly for them to shoot him down.
Supposing me to be an officer of their party the
troopers desisted at my remonstrance and left him to
me. Donald Roy was wounded in the foot, but
he managed to mount behind me. We got as far as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
the wall of the park when I saw a party of officers
approaching. Hastily dismounting, we led the horse
behind a nest of birches till they should pass. A few
yards from us a sorely wounded Highland officer was
lying. Macdonald recognized him as Charles Fraser,
younger of Inverallachie, the Lieutenant-Colonel of the
Fraser regiment and in the absence of the Master of
Lovat commander. We found no time to drag him
to safety before the English officers were upon us.</p>
<p>The approaching party turned out to be the Duke
of Cumberland himself, Major Wolfe, Lord Boyd, Sir
Robert Volney, and a boy officer of Wolfe&#8217;s regiment.
Young Fraser raised himself on his elbow to
look at the Duke. The Butcher reined in his horse,
frowning blackly down at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;To which side do you belong?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;To the Prince,&#8221; was the undaunted answer.</p>
<p>Cumberland, turning to Major Wolfe, said,</p>
<p>&#8220;Major, are your pistols loaded?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wolfe said that they were.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then shoot me that Highland scoundrel who
dares look on me so insolently.&#8221;</p>
<p>Major Wolfe looked at his commander very steadily
and said quietly: &#8220;Sir, my commission is at the disposal
of your Royal Highness, but my honour is my
own. I can never consent to become a common executioner.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>The Duke purpled, and burst out with, &#8220;Bah!
Pistol him, Boyd.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Highness asks what is not fitting for you to
require nor for me to perform,&#8221; answered that young
nobleman.</p>
<p>The Duke, in a fury, turned to a passing dragoon
and bade him shoot the young man. Charles Fraser
dragged himself to his feet by a great effort and
looked at the butcher with a face of infinite scorn
while the soldier was loading his piece.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Highness,&#8221; began Wolfe, about to remonstrate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir, I command you to be silent,&#8221; screamed the
Duke.</p>
<p>The trooper presented his piece at the Fraser,
whose steady eyes never left the face of Cumberland.</p>
<p>&#8220;God save King James!&#8221; cried Inverallachie in
English, and next moment fell dead from the discharge
of the musket.</p>
<p>The faces of the four Englishmen who rode with
the Duke were stern and drawn. Wolfe dismounted
from his horse and reverently covered the face of the
dead Jacobite with a kerchief.</p>
<p>&#8220;God grant that when our time comes we may die
as valiantly and as loyally as this young gentleman,&#8221;
he said solemnly, raising his hat.</p>
<p>Volney, Boyd, and Wolfe&#8217;s subaltern uncovered,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
and echoed an &#8220;Amen.&#8221; Cumberland glared from
one to another of them, ran the gamut of all tints
from pink to deepest purple, gulped out an apoplectic
Dutch oath, and dug the rowels deep into his bay.
With shame, sorrow, and contempt in their hearts his
retinue followed the butcher across the field.</p>
<p>My face was like the melting winter snows. I
could not look at the Macdonald, nor he at me. We
mounted in silence and rode away. Only once he
referred to what we had seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many&#8217;s the time that Charlie Fraser and I have
hunted the dun deer across the heather hills, and
now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He broke into Gaelic lamentation and
imprecation, then fell as suddenly to quiet.</p>
<p>We bore up a ravine away from the roads toward
where a great gash in the hills invited us, for we did
not need to be told that the chances of safety increased
with our distance from the beaten tracks of
travel. A man on horseback came riding behind and
overhauled us rapidly. Presently we saw that he was
a red-coated officer, and behind a huge rock we
waited to pistol him as he came up. The man leaped
from his horse and came straight toward us. I laid a
hand on Captain Roy&#8217;s arm, for I had recognized
Major Wolfe. But I was too late. A pistol ball went
slapping through the Major&#8217;s hat and knocked it
from his head. He stooped, replaced it with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
utmost composure, and continued to advance, at the
same time calling out that he was a friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;I recognized you behind the birches, Montagu,
and thought that you and your friend could use another
horse. Take my Galloway. You will find him
a good traveller.&#8221;</p>
<p>I ask you to believe that we stared long at him. A
wistful smile touched his sallow face.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not all ruffians in the English army, lad.
If I aid your escape it is because prisoners have no
rights this day. My advice would be for you to
strike for the hills.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In troth and I would think your advisings good,
sir,&#8221; answered Donald. &#8220;No glen will be too far, no
ben too high, for a hiding-place from these bloody
Sassenach dogs.&#8221; Then he stopped, the bitterness
fading from his voice, and added: &#8220;But I am forgetting
myself. God, sir, the sights I have seen this day
drive me mad. At all events there iss one English
officer Captain Macdonald will remember whatever.&#8221;
And the Highlander bowed with dignity.</p>
<p>I thanked Wolfe warmly, and lost no time in taking
his advice. Captain Roy&#8217;s foot had by this time
so swollen that he could not put it in the stirrup. He
was suffering a good deal, but at least the pain served
to distract him from the gloom that lay heavy on his
spirits. From the hillside far above the town we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
could see the lights of Inverness beginning to glimmer
as we passed. A score of times we had to dismount
on account of the roughness of the ground to lead
our horses along the steep incline of the mountainsides,
and each time Donald set his teeth and dragged
his shattered ankle through bracken and over boulder
by sheer dour pluck. Hunger gnawed at our vitals,
for in forty-eight hours we had but tasted food.
Deadly weariness hung on our stumbling footsteps,
and in our gloomy hearts lurked the coldness of despair.
Yet hour after hour we held our silent course,
clambering like heather-cats over cleugh and boggy
moorland, till at last we reached Bun Chraobg, where
we unsaddled for a snatch of sleep.</p>
<p>We flung ourselves down on the soft heather
wrapped in our plaids, but for long slumber was not
to be wooed. Our alert minds fell to a review of all
the horrors of the day: to friends struck down, to the
ghastly carnage, to fugitives hunted and shot in
their hiding-places like wild beasts, to the mistakes
that had ruined our already lost cause. The past and
the present were bitter as we could bear; thank
Heaven, the black shadow of the future hung as yet
but dimly on our souls. If we had had the second
sight and could have known what was to follow&mdash;the
countryside laid waste with fire and sword, women
and children turned out of their blazing homes to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
perish on the bleak moors, the wearing of the tartan
proscribed and made a crime punishable with death,
a hundred brave Highlanders the victim of the scaffold&mdash;we
should have quite despaired.</p>
<p>Except the gentle soughing of the wind there was
no sound to stir the silent night. A million of night&#8217;s
candles looked coldly down on an army of hunted
stragglers. I thought of the Prince, Cluny, Lord
Murray, Creagh, and a score of others, wondering if
they had been taken, and fell at last to troubled sleep,
from which ever and anon I started to hear the wild
wail of the pibroch or the ringing Highland slogans,
to see the flaming cannon mouths vomiting death or
the fell galloping of the relentless Hanoverian dragoons.</p>
<p>In the chill dawn I awoke to a ravening hunger
that was insistent to be noted, and though my eyes
would scarce believe there was Donald Roy cocked
tailor fashion on the heath arranging most temptingly
on a rock scone sandwiches of braxy mutton and a
flask of usquebaugh (Highland whiskey). I shut my
eyes, rubbed them with my forefingers, and again let
in the light. The viands were still there.</p>
<p>The Macdonald smiled whimsically over at me.
&#8220;Gin ye hae your appetite wi&#8217; you we&#8217;ll eat, Mr.
Montagu, for I&#8217;m a wee thingie hungry my nainsell
(myself). &#8217;Deed, to mak plain, I&#8217;m toom (empty) as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
a drum, and I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; that a drappie o&#8217; the usquebaugh
wad no&#8217; come amiss neither.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But where in the world did you get the food,
Donald?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And where wad you think, but doon at the bit
clachan yonder? A very guid freend of mine named
Farquhar Dhu lives there. He and Donald Roy are
far ben (intimate), and when I came knocking at his
window at cock-craw he was no&#8217; very laithe to gie me
a bit chack (lunch).&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you climb down the mountain and back with
your sore ankle?&#8221;</p>
<p>He coloured. &#8220;Hoots, man! Haud your whitter
(tongue)! Aiblins (perhaps) I wass just wearying for
a bit exercise to test it. And gin I were you I wadna
sit cocking on that stane speiring at me upsitten
(impertinent) questions like a professor of pheelosophy,
you muckle sumph!&#8221;</p>
<p>I fell to with a will. He was not a man to be thanked
in words. Long since I had found out that Captain
Roy was one to spend himself for his friends and
make nothing of it. This was one of his many
shining qualities that drew me so strongly to him. If
he had a few of the Highland faults he did not lack
any of the virtues of his race.</p>
<p>Shortly we were on our way once more, and were
fortunate enough before night to fall in with Cluny
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
and his clan, who having heard of our reverse had
turned about and were falling back to Badenoch. At
Trotternich we found a temporary refuge at the home
of a surgeon who was distantly related to the Macdonald,
but at the end of a fortnight were driven
away by the approach of a troop of Wolfe&#8217;s regiment.</p>
<p>The course of our wanderings I think it not needful
to detail at length. For months we were forever
on the move. From one hiding-place to another the
redcoats and their clan allies drove us. No sooner
were we fairly concealed than out we were routed.
Many a weary hundred miles we tramped over the
bleak mountains white with snow. Weariness walked
with us by day, and cold and hunger lay down with
us at night. Occasionally we slept in sheilings (sheep-huts),
but usually in caves or under the open sky.
Were we in great luck, venison and usquebaugh fell
to our portion, but more often our diet was brose
(boiling water poured over oatmeal) washed down by
a draught from the mountain burn. Now we would
be lurking on the mainland, now skulking on one of
the islands or crossing rough firths in crazy boats that
leaked like a sieve. Many a time it was touch and go
with us, for the dragoons and the Campbells followed
the trail like sleuths. We fugitives had a system of
signals by which we warned each other of the enemy&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
approach and conveyed to each other the news. That
Balmerino, Kilmarnock, and many another pretty man
had been taken we knew, and scores of us could have
guessed shrewdly where the Prince was hiding in the
heather hills.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>THE RED HEATHER HILLS</h3>
</div>

<p>A sullen day, full of chill gusts and drizzle,
sinking into a wet misty night! Three hunted
Jacobites, dragging themselves forward drearily,
found the situation one of utter cheerlessness. For
myself, misery spoke in every motion, and to say the
same of Creagh and Macdonald is to speak by the
card. Fatigue is not the name for our condition.
Fagged out, dispirited, with legs moving automatically,
we still slithered down cleughs, laboured through
dingles and corries, clambered up craggy mountainsides
all slippery with the wet heather, weariness
tugging at our leaden feet like a convict&#8217;s chain and
ball. Our bones ached, our throats were limekilns,
composts of sores were our ragged feet.</p>
<p>On every side the redcoats had hemmed us in, and
we knew not whether we tramped to a precarious
safety or to death. Indeed, &#8217;twas little we cared, for
at last exhaustion had touched the limit of endurance.
Not a word had passed the lips of any of us for
hours, lest the irritation of our worn nerves should
flame into open rupture.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></p>
<p>At length we stood on the summit of the ridge.
Scarce a half mile from us a shieling was to be seen
on the shoulder of the mount.</p>
<p>&#8220;That looks like the cot where O&#8217;Sullivan and the
Prince put up a month ago,&#8221; said Creagh.</p>
<p>Macdonald ruffled at the name like a turkeycock.
Since Culloden the word had been to him as a red rag
to a bull.</p>
<p>&#8220;The devil take O&#8217;Sullivan and his race,&#8221; burst out
the Scotch Captain. &#8220;Gin it had not been for him
the cause had not been lost.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Irishman&#8217;s hot temper flared.</p>
<p>&#8220;You forget the Macdonalds, sir,&#8221; he retorted,
tartly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What ails you at the Macdonalds?&#8221; demanded
the gentleman of that ilk, looking him over haughtily
from head to foot.</p>
<p>Creagh flung out his answer with an insolent laugh.
&#8220;Culloden.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Macdonald&#8217;s colour ebbed. &#8220;It will be a great
peety that you hafe insulted me, for there will presently
be a dead Irishman to stain the snow with hiss
blood,&#8221; he said deliberately, falling into more broken
English as he always did when excited.</p>
<p>Creagh shrugged. &#8220;That&#8217;s on the knees of the
gods. At the worst it leaves one less for the butcher
to hang, Scotch or Irish.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It sticks in my mind that I hafe heard you are a
pretty man with the steel&mdash;at the least I am thinking
so,&#8221; said Captain Roy, standing straight as an arrow,
his blue eyes fixed steadily on his opponent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gadso! Betwixt and between, but I dare say my
sword will serve to keep my head at all events whatefer,&#8221;
cried Creagh, mimicking scornfully the other&#8217;s
accent.</p>
<p>Donald whipped his sword from its scabbard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fery well. That will make easy proving, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>The quarrel had cropped out so quickly that hitherto
I had found no time to interfere, but now I came between
them and beat down the swords.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you mad, gentlemen? Put up your sword,
Tony. Back, Macdonald, or on my soul I&#8217;ll run you
through,&#8221; I cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, the pair of ye. Captain Roy can fend
for (look out for) himself,&#8221; shouted the excited Highlander,
thrusting at me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fall back, Tony, and let me have a word,&#8221; I
implored.</p>
<p>The Irishman disengaged, his anger nearly gone, a
whimsical smile already twitching at his mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Creagh, you don&#8217;t mean to impeach the courage
of Captain Macdonald, do you?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all&mdash;not at all. Faith, I never saw a man
more keen to fight,&#8221; he admitted, smiling.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He was wounded at Culloden. You know that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I have heard.&#8221; Then he added dryly, some
imp of mischief stirring him: &#8220;In the heel, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, in the foot,&#8221; I told him hastily. &#8220;I suppose
you do not doubt the valour of the Captain&#8217;s clan any
more than his own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Devil a bit!&#8221; he answered carelessly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen
them fight too often to admit of any question as to
their courage at all, at all. For sheer daring I never
saw the beat of the Highland troops&mdash;especially if
there chanced to be any plunder on the other side of
the enemy, Egad!&#8221;</p>
<p>I turned to Donald Roy, who was sullenly waiting
for me to have done. &#8220;Are you satisfied, Captain,
that Tony meant to impute nothing against you or
your men?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oich! Oich!&#8221; he grumbled. &#8220;I wass thinking I
heard some other dirty sneers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If the sneers were unjust I retract them with the
best will in the world. Come, Captain Macdonald,
sure &#8217;tis not worth our while doing the work of the
redcoats for them. &#8217;Slife, &#8217;tis not fair to Jack
Ketch!&#8221; exclaimed the Irishman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right, Donald! Why, you fire-eating Hotspur,
you began it yourself with a fling at the Irish. Make
up, man! Shake hands with Tony, and be done with
your bile.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>Creagh offered his hand, smiling, and his smile was
a handsome letter of recommendation. Donald&#8217;s face
cleared, and he gripped heartily the hand of the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;With great pleasure, and gin I said anything offensive
I eat my words at all events,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may say what you please about O&#8217;Sullivan,
Captain Macdonald. Ecod, he may go to the devil
for me,&#8221; Creagh told him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, and for me too; &#8217;fore God, the sooner the
better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If there is to be no throat-cutting to warm the
blood maybe we had better push on to the bothy, gentlemen.
I&#8217;m fain niddered [perishing] with the cold.
This Highland mist goes to the marrow,&#8221; I suggested
merrily, and linking arms with them I moved forward.</p>
<p>In ten minutes we had a roaring fire ablaze, and
were washing down with usquebaugh the last trace of
unkindness. After we had eaten our bannocks and
brose we lay in the shine of the flame and revelled in
the blessed heat, listening to the splash of the rain
outside. We were still encompassed by a cordon of
the enemy, but for the present we were content to
make the most of our unusual comfort.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a drammoch left in the flask. I give you
the restoration, gentlemen,&#8221; cried Donald.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder where the Prince is this night,&#8221; I said
after we had drunk the toast.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></p>
<p>We fell to a meditative sombre silence, and presently
Captain Roy began to sing softly one of those
touching Jacobite melodies that go to the source of tears
like rain to the roots of flowers. Donald had one of
the rare voices that carry the heart to laughter and to
sobs. The singer&#8217;s song, all pathos and tenderness,
played on the chords of our emotion like a harp.
My eyes began to smart. Creagh muttered something
about the peat-smoke affecting his, and I&#8217;m
fain to admit that I rolled over with my face from the
fire to hide the tell-tale tears. The haunting pathetic
wistfulness of the third stanza shook me with sobs.</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;Ohon! Ohon!&#8221; groaned Donald. &#8220;The evil day!
The evil day! Wae&#8217;s me for our bonnie Hieland
laddie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May the Blessed Mother keep him safe from all
enemies and dangers!&#8221; said Creagh softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And God grant that he be warm and well fed this
bitter night wherever he may be,&#8221; I murmured.</p>
<p>Something heavy like the butt of a musket fell
against the door, and we started to our feet in an instant.
Out flashed our swords.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who goes?&#8221; cried the Macdonald.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>We threw open the door, and in came a party of
four, rain dripping from their soaked plaids. I recognized
at once Young Clanranald and Major Macleod.
The other two were a tattered gillie in the Macdonald
tartan and a young woman of most engaging appearance,
who was supported in the arms of Clanranald
and his henchman. The exhausted lady proved to be
no other than the celebrated Miss Flora Macdonald,
whose gallant and generous devotion, for a protracted
period, as we afterwards learned, had undoubtedly
saved the life of the Prince from his enemies.</p>
<p>Donald no sooner beheld his kinswoman than he
dropped on his knee and with the wildest demonstrations
of joy kissed the hand of the ragged kerne who
supported her. I stared at Captain Roy in amazement,
and while I was yet wondering at his strange
behaviour Tony Creagh plumped down beside him.
My eyes went to the face of the gillie and encountered
the winsome smile of the Young Chevalier. Desperately
white and weary as he was, and dressed in an
outcast&#8217;s rags, he still looked every inch the son of
kings. To me he was always a more princely figure
in his days of adversity, when he roamed a hunted
wanderer among Highland heughs and corries with
only those about him over whose hearts he still was
king, than when he ruled at Holyrood undisputed
master of Scotland.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>It appeared that the party of the Prince, with the
exception of Clanranald, were destined for Raasay,
could they but run the cordon of troopers who
guarded the island of Skye. Through Malcolm, arrangements
had been made by which Murdoch Macleod,
a younger brother wounded at Culloden, was to
be in waiting with a boat to convey the party of the
Prince across the sound. It will be believed that we
discussed with much care and anxiety the best disposition
to be made of ourselves in running the lines of
the enemy. The final decision was that the Prince,
Malcolm, and I should make the attempt that night
while Creagh, Captain Roy, and Miss Flora followed
at their leisure on the morrow. Since the young lady
was provided with a passport for herself and her attendant
this promised to be a matter of small danger
on their part.</p>
<p>Never have I known a woman treated with truer
chivalry and deference than this heroic Highland girl
was by these hardy mountaineers. Her chief, Clanranald,
insisted on building with his own hands a fire
in her sleeping room &#8220;ben&#8221; the house, and in every
way the highest marks of respect were shown her for
her devotion to the cause. Though he expected to
join her again shortly, the Prince made her his warmest
acknowledgments of thanks in a spirit of pleasantry
which covered much tender feeling. They had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
been under fire together and had shared perils by land
and by sea during which time his conduct to her had
been perfect, a gentle consideration for her comfort
combined with the reserve that became a gentleman
under such circumstances. On this occasion he
elected to escort her in person to the door of her
chamber.</p>
<p>After a snatch of sleep we set out on our perillous
journey. Sheets of rain were now falling in a very
black night. Donald Roy parted from us at the door
of the hut with much anxiety. He had pleaded hard
to be allowed to join the party of the Prince, but had
been overruled on the ground that he was the only
one of us with the exception of Malcolm that could
act as a guide. Moreover he was the kinsman of
Miss Flora, and therefore her natural protector. Over
and over he urged us to be careful and to do nothing
rash. The Prince smilingly answered him with a
shred of the Gaelic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bithidh gach ni mar is aill Dhiu.&#8221; (All things
must be as God will have them.)</p>
<p>The blackness of the night was a thing to be felt.
Not the faithful Achates followed Æneas more closely
than did we the Macleod. No sound came to us but
the sloshing of the rain out of a sodden sky and the
noise of falling waters from mountain burns in spate
(flood). Hour after hour while we played blindly follow-my-leader
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
the clouds were a sieve over our devoted
heads. Braes we breasted and precipitous
heathery heights we sliddered down, but there was always
rain and ever more rain, turning at last into a
sharp thin sleet that chilled the blood.</p>
<p>Then in the gray breaking of the day Malcolm
turned to confess what I had already suspected, that
he had lost the way in the darkness. We were at
present shut in a sea of fog, a smirr of mist and rain,
but when that lifted he could not promise that we
would not be close on the campfires of the dragoons.
His fine face was a picture of misery, and bitterly he
reproached himself for the danger into which he had
led the Prince. The Young Chevalier told him gently
that no blame was attaching to him; rather to us all
for having made the attempt in such a night.</p>
<p>For another hour we sat on the dripping heather
opposite the corp-white face of the Macleod waiting
for the mist to lift. The wanderer exerted himself to
keep us in spirits, now whistling a spring of
Clanranald&#8217;s march, now retailing to us the story of
how he had walked through the redcoats as Miss
Macdonald&#8217;s Betty Burke. It may be conceived with
what anxiety we waited while the cloud of moisture
settled from the mountain tops into the valleys.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Heaven, sir, we have a chance,&#8221; cried Malcolm
suddenly, and began to lead the way at a great pace
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
up the steep slope. For a half hour we scudded
along, higher and higher, always bearing to the right
and at such a burst of speed that I judged we must be
in desperate danger. The Prince hung close to the
heels of Malcolm, but I was a sorry laggard ready to
die of exhaustion. When the mist sank we began to
go more cautiously, for the valley whence we had just
emerged was dotted at intervals with the campfires of
the soldiers. Cautiously we now edged our way along
the slippery incline, keeping in the shadow of great
rocks and broom wherever it was possible. &#8217;Tis not in
nature to walk unmoved across an open where every
bush may hide a sentinel who will let fly at one as
gladly as at a fat buck&mdash;yes, and be sure of thirty
thousand pounds if he hit the right mark. I longed
for eyes in the back of my head, and every moment
could feel the lead pinging its way between my shoulder
blades.</p>
<p>Major Macleod had from his youth stalked the wary
stag, and every saugh and birch and alder in our
course was made to yield us its cover. Once a muircock
whirred from my very feet and brought my heart
to my mouth. Presently we topped the bluff and disappeared
over its crest. Another hour of steady
tramping down hill and the blue waters of the sound
stretched before us. &#8217;Twas time. My teeth chattered
and my bones ached. I was sick&mdash;sick&mdash;sick.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And here we are at the last,&#8221; cried the Major with
a deep breath of relief. &#8220;I played the gomeral brawly,
but in the darkness we blundered ram-stam through
the Sassenach lines.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Fortuna favet fatuis,&#8217;&#8221; quoted the Young Chevalier.
&#8220;Luck for fools! The usurper&#8217;s dragoons will
have to wait another day for their thirty thousand
pounds. Eh, Montagu?&#8221; he asked me blithely; then
stopped to stare at me staggering down the beach.
&#8220;What ails you, man?&#8221;</p>
<p>I was reeling blindly like a drunkard, and our Prince
put an arm around my waist. I resisted feebly, but he
would have none of it; the arm of a king&#8217;s son (de
jure) supported me to the boat.</p>
<p>We found as boatmen not only Murdoch Macleod
but his older brother Young Raasay, the only one of
the family that had not been &#8220;out&#8221; with our army.
He had been kept away from the rebellion to save the
family estates, but his heart was none the less with us.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what folly is this, Ronald?&#8221; cried Malcolm
when he saw the head of the house on the links.
&#8220;Murdoch and I are already as black as we can be,
but you were to keep clean of the Prince&#8217;s affairs.
It wad be a geyan ill outcome gin we lost the estates
after all. The red cock will aiblins craw at Raasay
for this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wass threepin&#8217; so already, but he wass dooms
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
thrang to come. He&#8217;ll maybe get his craig raxed
(neck twisted) for his ploy,&#8221; said Murdoch composedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Heaven, Malcolm, I&#8217;ll play the trimmer no
longer. Raasay serves his Prince though it cost both
the estate and his head,&#8221; cried the young chieftain
hotly.</p>
<p>&#8220;In God&#8217;s name then let us get away before the
militia or the sidier roy (red soldiers) fall in with us.
In the woody cleughs yonder they are thick as blackcocks
in August,&#8221; cried the Major impatiently.</p>
<p>We pushed into the swirling waters and were presently
running free, sending the spurling spray flying on
both sides of the boat. The wind came on to blow
pretty hard and the leaky boat began to fill, so that we
were hard put to it to keep from sinking. The three
brothers were quite used to making the trip in foul
weather, but on the Prince&#8217;s account were now much
distressed. To show his contempt for danger, the
royal wanderer sang a lively Erse song. The Macleods
landed us at Glam, and led the way to a
wretched hovel recently erected by some shepherds.
Here we dined on broiled kid, butter, cream, and oaten
bread.</p>
<p>I slept round the clock, and awoke once more a
sound man to see the Prince roasting the heart of the
kid on an iron spit. Throughout the day we played
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
with a greasy pack of cards to pass the time. About
sundown Creagh joined us, Macdonald having stayed
on Skye to keep watch on any suspicious activity
of the clan militia or the dragoons. Raasay&#8217;s clansmen,
ostensibly engaged in fishing, dotted the shore
of the little island to give warning of the approach of
any boats. To make our leader&#8217;s safety more certain,
the two proscribed brothers took turns with Creagh
and me in doing sentinel duty at the end of the path
leading to the sheep hut.</p>
<p>At the desire of the Prince&mdash;and how much more
at mine!&mdash;we ventured up to the great house that
night to meet the ladies, extraordinary precautions
having been taken by Raasay to prevent the possibility
of any surprise. Indeed, so long as the Prince
was in their care, Raasay and his brothers were as
anxious as the proverbial hen with the one chick.
Doubtless they felt that should he be captured while
on the island the reputation of the house would be
forever blasted. And this is the most remarkable fact
of Charles Edward Stuart&#8217;s romantic history; that in
all the months of his wandering, reposing confidence
as he was forced to do in hundreds of different persons,
many of them mere gillies and some of them
little better than freebooters, it never seems to have
occurred to one of these shag-headed Gaels to earn an
immense fortune by giving him up.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>My heart beat a tattoo against my ribs as I followed
the Prince and Raasay to the drawing-room where his
sister and Miss Macdonald awaited us. Eight months
had passed since last I had seen my love; eight
months of battle, of hairbreadth escapes, and of hardships
scarce to be conceived. She too had endured
much in that time. Scarce a house in Raasay but
had been razed by the enemy because her brothers
and their following had been &#8220;out&#8221; with us. I was
to discover whether her liking for me had outlived the
turmoils of &#8220;the &#8217;45,&#8221; or had been but a girlish fancy.</p>
<p>My glance flashed past Miss Flora Macdonald and
found Aileen on the instant. For a hundredth part
of a second our eyes met before she fell to making her
devoirs to the Young Chevalier, and after that I did
not need to be told that my little friend was still
staunch and leal. I could afford to wait my turn with
composure, content to watch with long-starved eyes
the delicacy and beauty of this sweet wild rose I coveted.
Sure, hers was a charm that custom staled not
nor longer acquaintance made less alluring. Every
mood had its own characteristic fascination, and are
not the humours of a woman numberless? She had
always a charming note of unconventional freshness, a
childlike <i>naiveté</i> of immaturity and unsophistication
at times, even a certain girlish shy austerity that had
for me a touch of saintliness. But there&mdash; Why
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
expatiate? A lover&#8217;s midsummer madness, you will
say!</p>
<p>My turn at last! The little brown hand pressed
mine firmly for an instant, the warm blue eyes met
mine full and true, the pulse in the soft-throated neck
beat to a recognition of my presence. I found time to
again admire the light poise of the little head carried
with such fine spirit, the music of the broken English
speech in this vibrant Highland voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome&mdash; Welcome to Raasay, my friend!&#8221;
Then her eyes falling on the satin cockade so faded
and so torn, there came a tremulous little catch to her
voice, a fine light to her eyes. &#8220;It iss the good tale
that my brothers have been telling me of Kenneth Montagu&#8217;s
brave devotion to hiss friends, but I wass not
needing to hear the story from them. I will be thinking
that I knew it all already,&#8221; she said, a little timidly.</p>
<p>I bowed low over her hand and kissed it. &#8220;My
friends make much of nothing. Their fine courage
reads their own spirit reflected in the eyes of others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, then I will have heard the story wrong. It
would be Donald who went back to Drummossie
Moor after you when you were wounded?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could a friend do less?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or more?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He would have done as much for me. My plain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
duty!&#8221; I said, shrugging, anxious to be done with the
subject.</p>
<p>She looked at me with sparkling eyes, laughing at
my discomposure, in a half impatience of my stolid
English phlegm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you men! You go to your death for a friend,
and if by a miracle you escape: &#8216;Pooh! &#8217;Twas nothing
whatever. Gin it rain to-morrow, I think &#8217;twill be
foul,&#8217; you say, and expect to turn it off so.&#8221;</p>
<p>I took the opening like a fox.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith, I hope it will not rain to-morrow,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;I have to keep watch outside. Does the sun never
shine in Raasay, Aileen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whiles,&#8221; she answered, laughing. &#8220;And are all
Englishmen so shy of their virtues?&#8221;</p>
<p>Tony Creagh coming up at that moment, she referred
the question to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, I can&#8217;t say,&#8221; he answered unsmilingly.
&#8220;&#8217;Fraid I&#8217;m out of court. Never knew an Englishman
to have any.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you spare them one at the least?&#8221; Aileen
implored, gaily.</p>
<p>He looked at her, then at me, a twinkle in his
merry Irish eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ecod then, I concede them one! They&#8217;re good
sportsmen. They follow the game until they&#8217;ve
bagged it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>We two flushed in concert, but the point of her wit
touched Creagh on the <i>riposte</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The men of the nation being disposed of in such
cavalier fashion, what shall we say of the ladies, sir?&#8221;
she asked demurely.</p>
<p>&#8220;That they are second only to the incomparable
maidens of the North,&#8221; he answered, kissing her hand
in his extravagant Celtic way.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I will not be fubbed off with your Irish blarney.
The English ladies, Mr. Creagh?&#8221; she merrily
demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Tony, you renegade! Have I not heard
you toast a score of times the beauties of London?&#8221;
said I, coming up with the heavy artillery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never, I vow. Sure I always thought Edinburgh
a finer city&mdash;not so dirty and, pink me, a
vast deal more interesting. Now London is
built&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the Thames. So it is,&#8221; I interrupted dryly.
&#8220;And&mdash;to get back to the subject under discussion&mdash;the
pink and white beauties of London are built to
take the eye and ensnare the heart of roving Irishmen.
Confess!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or be forever shamed as recreant knight,&#8221; cried
Aileen, her blue eyes bubbling with laughter.</p>
<p>Tony unbuckled his sword and offered it her. &#8220;If
I yield &#8217;tis not to numbers but to beauty. Is my confession
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
to be in the general or the particular, Miss
Macleod?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, in the particular! &#8217;Twill be the mair interesting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith then, though it be high treason to say so of
one lady before another, Tony Creagh&#8217;s scalp dangles
at the belt of the most bewitching little charmer in
Christendom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mistress Antoinette Westerleigh, London&#8217;s reigning
toast.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aileen clapped her hands in approving glee.</p>
<p>&#8220;And did you ever tell her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A score of times. Faith, &#8217;twas my rule to propose
every second time I saw her and once in between.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And she&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Laughed at me; played shill-I-shall-I with my devotion;
vowed she would not marry me till I had
been killed in the wars to prove I was a hero; smiled
on me one minute and scorned me the next.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you love her still?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The sun rises in &#8217;Toinette&#8217;s eyes; when she frowns
the day is vile.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite her whims and arrogances?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure for me my queen can do no wrong. &#8217;Tis
her right to laugh and mock at me so only she enjoy it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>Aileen stole one shy, quick, furtive look at me. It
seemed to question whether her lover was such a pattern
of meek obedience.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you never falter? There iss no other woman
for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Saving your presence, there is no other woman in
the world?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes glistened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kneel down, sir,&#8221; she commanded.</p>
<p>Tony dropped to a knee. She touched him lightly
on the shoulder with his sword.</p>
<p>&#8220;In love&#8217;s name I dub you worthy knight. Be
bold, be loyal, be fortunate. Arise, Sir Anthony
Creagh, knight of the order of Cupid!&#8221;</p>
<p>We three had wandered away together into an
alcove, else, &#8217;tis almost needless to say, our daffing
had not been so free. Now Malcolm joined us with a
paper in his hand. He spoke to me, smiling yet
troubled too.</p>
<p>&#8220;More labours, O my Theseus! More Minotaurs
to slay! More labyrinths to thread!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what may be these labours now?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Donald Roy sends for you. He reports
unusual activity among the clan militia and the redcoats
on Skye. A brig landed men and officers
there yesterday. And what for will they be coming?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think the reason is very plain, Major Macleod,&#8221;
said Tony blithely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m jalousing (suspecting) so mysel&#8217;. They will
be for the taking of a wheen puir callants (lads) that
are jinking (hiding) in the hill birken (scrub). But
here iss the point that must be learned: do they ken
that the Prince iss on the islands?&#8221;</p>
<p>Creagh sprang to his feet from the chair in which
he had been lazying. &#8220;The devil&#8217;s in it! Why
should Montagu go? Why not I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you can&#8217;t talk the Gaelic, Creagh.
You&#8217;re barred,&#8221; I told him triumphantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you be sending our guest on such an errand
of danger, Malcolm?&#8221; asked Aileen in a low
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not I, but Fegs! I will never say the word to
hinder if he volunteers. &#8217;Tis in the service of the
Prince. The rest of us are kent (known) men and
canna gang.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grouped behind Malcolm were now gathered the
Prince, Raasay, and Miss Flora. To me as a focus
came all eyes. I got to my feet in merry humour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma foi! Ulysses as a wanderer is not to be
compared with me. When do I set out, Major?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At skreigh-o&#8217;-day (daybreak). And the sooner
you seek your sleep the better. Best say good-night
to the lassies, for you&#8217;ll need be wide awake the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
morn twa-three hours ere sun-up. Don&#8217;t let the redcoats
wile (lure) you into any of their traps, lad. You
maunna lose your head or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;Or I&#8217;ll lose my head,&#8221; I answered, drolling.
&#8220;I take you, Major; but, my word for it, I have not,
played hide-and-go-seek six months among your
Highland lochs and bens to dance on air at the last.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Prince drew me aside. &#8220;This will not be forgotten
when our day of power comes, Montagu. I
expected no less of your father&#8217;s son.&#8221; Then he
added with a smile: &#8220;And when Ulysses rests safe
from his wanderings at last I trust he will find his
Penelope waiting for him with a true heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without more ado I bade Miss Macdonald and
Aileen good-bye, but as I left the room I cast a last
look back over my shoulder and methought that the
lissome figure of my love yearned forward toward me
tenderly and graciously.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>VOLNEY PAYS A DEBT</h3>
</div>

<p>There are some to whom strange changes
never come. They pursue the even tenor of
their way in humdrum monotony, content to
tread the broad safe path of routine. For them the
fascination of the mountain peaks of giddy chance has
no allurement, the swift turbulent waters of intrigue
no charm. There are others with whom Dame Fortune
plays many an exciting game, and to these adventure
becomes as the very breath of life. To such
every hazard of new fortune is a diversion to be
eagerly sought.</p>
<p>Something of this elation seized me&mdash;for I am of
this latter class&mdash;as Murdoch and his gillies rowed
me across the sound to Skye in the darkness of the
early morning. It was a drab dawn as ever I have
seen, and every tug at the oars shot me nearer to the
red bloodhounds who were debouched over the island.
What then? Was I not two years and twenty, and
did I not venture for the life of a king&#8217;s son? To-day
I staked my head on luck and skill; to-morrow&mdash;but
let the future care for her own.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></p>
<p>In a grove of beeches about half a mile from Portree
we landed, and Murdoch gave the call of the
whaup to signal Donald Roy. From a clump of
whins in the gorse the whistle echoed back to us, and
presently Captain Macdonald came swinging down to
the shore. It appeared that another boatload of soldiers
had been landed during the night, a squad of
clan militia under the command of a Lieutenant Campbell.
We could but guess that this portended some
knowledge as to the general whereabouts of the
Prince, and &#8217;twas my mission to learn the extent and
reliability of that knowledge if I could. That there
was some danger in the attempt I knew, but it had
been minimized by the philibeg and hose, the Glengarry
bonnet and Macleod plaid which I had donned
at the instance of Malcolm.</p>
<p>I have spoken of chance. The first stroke of it fell
as I strode along the highway to Portree. At a
crossroad intersection I chanced on a fellow trudging
the same way as myself. He was one of your furtive-faced
fellows, with narrow slits of eyes and an acquired
habit of skellying sidewise at one out of them. Cunning
he was beyond doubt, and from the dour look of
him one to bear malice. His trews were like Joseph&#8217;s
coat for the colour of the many patches, but I made
them out to have been originally of the Campbell
plaid.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A fine day, my man,&#8221; says I with vast irony.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wha&#8217;s finding faut wi&#8217; the day?&#8221; he answers
glumly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be from across the mountains on the mainland
by the tongue of you,&#8221; I ventured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gin you ken that there&#8217;ll be nae use telling you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A Campbell, I take it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned his black-a-vised face on me, scowling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or perhaps you&#8217;re on the other side of the hedge&mdash;implicated
in this barelegged rebellion, I dare say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under my smiling, watchful eye he began to grow
restless. His hand crept to his breast, and I heard
the crackle of papers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Deil hae&#8217;t, what&#8217;s it to you?&#8221; he growled.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me? Oh, nothing at all. Merely a friendly
interest. On the whole I think my first guess right.
I wouldn&#8217;t wonder but you&#8217;re carrying dispatches
from Lieutenant Campbell.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fellow went all colours and was as easy as a
worm on a hook.</p>
<p>&#8220;I make no doubt you&#8217;ll be geyan tired from long
travel, and the responsibility of carrying such important
documents must weigh down your spirits,&#8221; I
drolled, &#8220;and so I will trouble you&#8221;&mdash;with a pistol
clapped to his head and a sudden ring of command
in my voice&mdash;&#8220;to hand them over to me at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fellow&#8217;s jaw dropped lankly. He looked hither
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
and thither for a way of escape and found none. He
was confronting an argument that had a great deal of
weight with him, and out of the lining of his bonnet
he ripped a letter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, but I&#8217;ll take the one in your breast
pocket,&#8221; I told him dryly.</p>
<p>Out it came with a deal of pother. The letter was
addressed to the Duke of Cumberland, Portree, Skye.
My lips framed themselves to a long whistle. Here
was the devil to pay. If the butcher was on the
island I knew he had come after bigger game than
muircocks. No less a quarry than the Prince himself
would tempt him to this remote region. I marched
my prisoner back to Captain Roy and Murdoch. To
Donald I handed the letter, and he ripped it open without
ceremony. &#8217;Twas merely a note from the Campbell
Lieutenant of militia, to say that the orders of his
Highness regarding the watching of the coast would
be fulfilled to the least detail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, and here&#8217;s a pirn to unravel. What&#8217;s to
be done now?&#8221; asked the Macdonald.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Heaven, I have it,&#8221; cried I. &#8220;Let Murdoch
carry the news to Raasay that the Prince may get
away at once. Do you guard our prisoner here,
while I, dressed in his trews and bonnet, carry the
letter to the Duke. His answer may throw more light
on the matter.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>Not to make long, so it was decided. We made
fashion to plaster up the envelope so as not to show a
casual looker that it had been tampered with, and I
footed it to Portree in the patched trews of the
messenger, not with the lightest heart in the world.
The first redcoat I met directed me to the inn where
the Duke had his headquarters, and I was presently
admitted to a hearing.</p>
<p>The Duke was a ton of a little man with the
phlegmatic Dutch face. He read the letter stolidly
and began to ask questions as to the disposition of our
squad. I lied generously, magnificently, my face
every whit as wooden as his; and while I was still at
it the door behind me opened and a man came in
leisurely. He waited for the Duke to have done with
me, softly humming a tune the while, his shadow
flung in front across my track; and while he lilted
there came to me a dreadful certainty that on
occasion I had heard the singer and his song before.</p>

<p>carolled the melodious voice lazily. Need I say
that it belonged to my umquhile friend Sir Robert
Volney.</p>
<p>Cumberland brushed me aside with a wave of his
hand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Donner! If the Pretender is on Skye&mdash;and he
must be&mdash;we&#8217;ve got him trapped, Volney. Our
cordon stretches clear across the isle, and every outlet
is guarded,&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Immensely glad to hear it, sir. Let&#8217;s see! Is
this the twelfth time you&#8217;ve had him sure? &#8217;Pon
honour, he must have more lives than the proverbial
cat,&#8221; drawled Sir Robert insolently.</p>
<p>There was one thing about Volney I could never
enough admire. He was no respecter of persons.
Come high, come low, the bite of his ironic tongue
struck home. For a courtier he had the laziest scorn
of those he courted that ever adventurer was hampered
with; and strangely enough from him his friends in
high place tolerated anything. The Prince of Wales
and his brother Cumberland would not speak to each
other, yet each of them fought to retain Volney as
his follower. Time-servers wondered that his uncurbed
speech never brought him to grief. Perhaps
the secret of his security lay in his splendid careless
daring; in that, and in his winning personality.</p>
<p>&#8220;By God, Volney, sometimes I think you&#8217;re half a
Jacobite,&#8221; said Cumberland, frowning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Grace does me injustice. My bread is
buttered on the Brunswick side,&#8221; answered the baronet,
carelessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But otherwise&mdash;at heart&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>Volney&#8217;s sardonic smile came into play. &#8220;Otherwise
my well-known caution, and my approved loyalty,&mdash;Egad,
I had almost forgotten that!&mdash;refute
such an aspersion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Himmel! If your loyalty is no greater than your
caution it may be counted out. At the least you take
delight in tormenting me. Never deny it, man! I
believe you want the Pretender to get away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One may wish the Prince&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Prince?&#8221; echoed Cumberland, blackly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Young Chevalier then, if you like that better.
&#8217;Slife, what&#8217;s in a name? One may wish him to
escape and be guilty of no crime. He and his brave
Highlanders deserve a better fate than death. I dare
swear that half your redcoats have the sneaking desire
to see the young man win free out of the country.
Come, my good fellow&#8221;&mdash;turning to me&mdash;&#8220;What do
they call you&mdash;Campbell? Well then, Campbell,
speak truth and shame the devil. Are you as keen
to have the Young Chevalier taken as you pretend?&#8221;</p>
<p>Doggedly I turned my averted head toward him,
saw the recognition leap to his eyes, and waited for
the word to fall from his lips that would condemn me.
Amusement chased amazement across his face.</p>
<p>A moment passed, still another moment. The
word was not spoken. Instead he began to smile,
presently to hum,

<p>&#8220;Come, Mont-Campbell, you haven&#8217;t answered my
question yet. If you knew where Charles Edward
Stuart was in hiding would you give him up?&#8221; He
looked at me from under lowered lids, vastly entertained,
playing with me as a cat does with a mouse.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a fery good servant of the King, God bless
him whatefer, and I would just do my duty,&#8221; answered
I, still keeping the rôle I had assumed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course he would. Ach, liebe himmel! Any
loyal man would be bound to do so,&#8221; broke in Cumberland.</p>
<p>Volney&#8217;s eyes shone. &#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Now supposing, sir, that one had a very dear friend
among the rebels; given the chance, ought he to turn
him over to justice?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt about it. Friendship ends when rebellion
begins,&#8221; said the Duke, sententiously.</p>
<p>Sir Robert continued blandly to argue the case,
looking at me out of the tail of his eye. Faith, he
enjoyed himself prodigiously, which was more than I
did, for I was tasting a bad quarter of an hour. &#8220;Put
it this way, sir: I have a friend who has done me
many good turns. Now assume that I have but to
speak the word to send him to his death. Should the
word be spoken?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>The Duke said dogmatically that a soldier&#8217;s first
duty was to work for the success of his cause regardless
of private feelings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or turn it this way,&#8221; continued Volney, &#8220;that the
man is not a friend. Suppose him a rival claimant to
an estate I mean to possess. Can I in honour give
him up? What would you think, Mont&mdash;er&mdash;Campbell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not Mont-Campbell, but Campbell,&#8221; I corrected.
&#8220;I will be thinking, sir, that it would be a matter for
your conscience, and at all events it iss fery lucky that
you do not hafe to decide it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still the case might arise. It&#8217;s always well to be
prepared,&#8221; he answered, laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Robert! What the deuce do you mean
by discussing such a matter with a Highland kerne?
I never saw your match for oddity,&#8221; said the Duke.</p>
<p>While he was still speaking there was a commotion
in the outer room of the inn. There sounded a rap at
the door, and on the echo of the knock an officer came
into the room to announce the capture of a suspect.
He was followed by the last man in the world I wanted
to see at that moment, no other than the Campbell
soldier whose place I was usurping. The fat was in
the fire with a vengeance now, and though I fell back
to the rear I knew it was but a question of time till his
eye lit on me.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></p>
<p>The fellow began to tell his story, got nearly
through before his ferret eyes circled round to me,
then broke off to burst into a screed of the Gaelic as
he pointed a long finger at me.</p>
<p>The Duke flung round on me in a cold fury. &#8220;Is
this true, fellow?&#8221;</p>
<p>I came forward shrugging.</p>
<p>&#8220;To deny were folly when the evidence is writ so
plain,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And who the devil are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kenneth Montagu, at your service.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cumberland ordered the room cleared, then turned
on Volney a very grim face. &#8220;I&#8217;ll remember this, Sir
Robert. You knew him all the time. It has a bad
look, I make plain to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas none of my business. Your troopers can
find enough victims for you without my pointing out
any. I take the liberty of reminding your Highness
that I&#8217;m not a hangman by profession,&#8221; returned
Volney stiffly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You go too far, sir,&#8221; answered the Duke haughtily.
&#8220;I know my duty too well to allow me to be deterred
from performing it by you or by anybody else. Mr.
Montagu, have you any reason to give why I should
not hang you for a spy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No reason that would have any weight with your
Grace,&#8221; I answered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>He looked long at me, frowning blackly out of the
grimmest face I had ever fronted; and yet that countenance,
inexorable as fate, belonged to a young man
not four years past his majority.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without dubiety you deserve death,&#8221; he said at
the last, &#8220;but because of your youth I give you one
chance. Disclose to me the hiding-place of the Pretender
and you shall come alive out of the valley of
the shadow.&#8221;</p>
<p>A foretaste of the end clutched icily at my heart,
but the price of the proffered safety was too great.
Since I must die, I resolved that it should be with a
good grace.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know whom your Grace can mean by the
Pretender.&#8221;</p>
<p>His heavy jaw set and his face grew cold and hard
as steel.</p>
<p>&#8220;You fool, do you think to bandy words with me?
You will speak or by heaven you will die the death
of a traitor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I need not fear to follow where so many of my brave
comrades have shown the way,&#8221; I answered steadily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bah! You deal in heroics. Believe me, this is no
time for theatricals. Out with it. When did you last
see Charles Stuart?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can find no honourable answer to that question,
sir.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then your blood be on your own head, fool.
You die to-morrow morning by the cord.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As God wills; perhaps to-morrow, perhaps not for
fifty years.&#8221;</p>
<p>While I was being led out another prisoner passed
in on his way to judgment. The man was Captain
Roy Macdonald.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m wae to see you here, lad, and me the cause of
it by sending you,&#8221; he said, smiling sadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;How came they to take you?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was surprised on the beach just after Murdoch
left,&#8221; he told me in the Gaelic so that the English
troopers might not understand. &#8220;All should be well
with the yellow haired laddie now that the warning
has been given. Are you for Carlisle, Kenneth?&#8221;</p>
<p>I shook my head. &#8220;No, my time is set for to-morrow.
If they give you longer you&#8217;ll find a way to
send word to Aileen how it went with me, Donald?&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded, and we gripped hands in silence, our
eyes meeting steadily. From his serene courage I
gathered strength.</p>
<p>They took me to a bothy in the village which had
been set apart as a prison for me, and here, a picket of
soldiers with loaded muskets surrounding the hut, they
left me to myself. I had asked for paper and ink, but
my request had been refused.</p>
<p>In books I have read how men under such circumstance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
came quietly to philosophic and religious contemplation,
looking at the issue with the far-seeing
eyes of those who count death but an incident. But
for me, I am neither philosopher nor saint. Connected
thought I found impossible. My mind was
alive with fleeting and chaotic fragmentary impulses.
Memories connected with Cloe, Charles, Balmerino,
and a hundred others occupied me. Trivial forgotten
happenings flashed through my brain. All the different
Aileens that I knew trooped past in procession.
Gay and sad, wistful and merry, eager and reflective,
in passion and in tender guise, I saw my love in all
her moods; and melted always at the vision of her.</p>
<p>I descended to self-pity, conceiving myself a hero
and a martyr, revelling in an agony of mawkish sentiment
concerning the post-mortem grief of my friends.
From this at length I snatched myself by calling to
mind the many simple Highlanders who had preceded
me in the past months without any morbid craving for
applause. Back harked my mind to Aileen, imagination
spanning the future as well as the past. Tender
pity and love suffused me. Mingled with all my
broken reflections was many a cry of the heart for
mercy to a sinner about to render his last account and
for healing balm to that dear friend who would be left
to mourn the memory of me painted in radiant colours.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>Paradoxical though it may seem, the leaden hours
flew on feathered foot. Dusk fell, then shortly darkness.
Night deepened, and the stars came out.
From the window I watched the moon rise till it
flooded the room with its pale light, my mind at last
fallen into the sombre quiet of deep abstraction.</p>
<p>A mocking voice brought me to earth with a start.</p>
<p>&#8220;Romantic spectacle! A world bathed in moonlight.
Do you compose verses to your love&#8217;s bright
eyes, Mr. Montagu? Or perhaps an epitaph for
some close friend?&#8221;</p>
<p>An elegant figure in dark cloak, riding boots, and
three-cornered hat confronted me, when I slowly
turned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hope I don&#8217;t intrude,&#8221; he said jauntily.</p>
<p>I gave him a plain hint. &#8220;Sir Robert, like Lord
Chesterfield, when he was so ill last year, if I do not
press you to remain it is because I must rehearse my
funeral obsequies.&#8221;</p>
<p>His laugh rang merrily. Coming forward a step or
two, he flung a leg across the back of a chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Egad, you&#8217;re not very hospitable, my friend. Or
isn&#8217;t this your evening at home?&#8221; he fleered.</p>
<p>I watched him narrowly, answering nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cozy quarters,&#8221; he said, looking round with polite
interest. &#8220;May I ask whether you have taken them
for long?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The object of your visit, sir,&#8221; I demanded coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;There you gravel me,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;I wish I
knew the motives for my visit. They are perhaps a
blend&mdash;some pique, some spite, some curiosity, and
faith! a little admiration, Mr. Montagu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All of which being presumably now satisfied&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they&#8217;re not, man! Far from it. And so I
accept the courteous invitation you were about to extend
me to prolong my call and join you in a glass of
wine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seeing that he was determined to remain willy-nilly,
I made the best of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have interpreted my sentiments exactly, Sir
Robert,&#8221; I told him. &#8220;But I fear the wine will have to
be postponed till another meeting. My cellar is not
well stocked.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew a flask from his pocket, found glasses on
the table, and filled them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let me thus far play host, Mr. Montagu.
Come, I give you a toast!&#8221; He held the glass to the
light and viewed the wine critically. &#8220;&#8217;T is a devilish
good vintage, though I say it myself. Montagu, may
you always find a safe port in time of storm!&#8221; he said
with jesting face, but with a certain undercurrent of
meaning that began to set my blood pounding.</p>
<p>But though I took a glimmer of the man&#8217;s purpose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
I would not meet him half-way. If he had any
proposal to make the advances must come from him.
Nor would I allow myself to hope too much.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217; faith, &#8217;tis a good port,&#8221; I said, and eyed the
wine no less judicially than he.</p>
<p>Volney&#8217;s gaze loitered deliberately over the cottage
furnishings. &#8220;Cozy enough, but after all not quite to
my liking, if I may make so bold as to criticise your
apartments. I wonder now you don&#8217;t make a
change.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking of moving to-morrow,&#8221; I told him
composedly. &#8220;To a less roomy apartment, but one
just as snug.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall you live there permanently?&#8221; he asked with
innocent face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall stay there permanently,&#8221; I corrected.</p>
<p>Despite my apparent unconcern I was playing
desperately for my life. That Volney was dallying
with some plan of escape for me I became more confident,
and I knew from experience that nothing
would touch the man on his weak side so surely as an
imperturbable manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mentioned pique and spite, Mr. Montagu, and
you did not take my meaning. Believe me, not
against you, but against that oaf Cumberland,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what may your presence here have to do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
with your pique against the Duke? I confess that
the connection is not plain to me,&#8221; I said in careless
fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;After you left to-day, Mr. Montagu, I humbled
myself to ask a favour of the Dutchman&mdash;the first I
ever asked, and I have done him many. He refused
it and turned his back on me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The favour was&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That you might be taken to London for trial and
executed there.&#8221;</p>
<p>I looked up as if surprised. &#8220;And why this interest
on my behalf, Sir Robert?&#8221;</p>
<p>He shrugged. &#8220;I do not know&mdash;a fancy&mdash;a
whim. George Selwyn would never forgive me if I
let you be hanged and he not there to see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Had you succeeded Selwyn would have had you
to thank for a pleasant diversion, but I think you remarked
that the Dutchman was obstinate. &#8217;Tis a pity&mdash;for
Selwyn&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides, I had another reason. You and I had set
ourselves to play out a certain game in which I took
an interest. Now I do not allow any blundering
foreigners to interfere with my amusements.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you mean you do not like the foreigner
to anticipate you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By God, I do not allow him to when I can prevent
it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But as in this instance you cannot prevent it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
My sentence tailed into a yawn.</p>
<p>&#8220;That remains to be seen,&#8221; he retorted, and
whipped off first one boot and then the other. The
unfastened cloak fell to the floor, and he began to unloose
his doublet.</p>
<p>I stared calmly, though my heart stood still.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, Sir Robert! Are you going to stay all
night? I fear my accommodations are more
limited than those to which you have been accustomed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t stand gaping there, Montagu. Get off
those uncivilized rags of yours and slip on these.
You&#8217;re going out as Sir Robert Volney.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am desolated to interfere with your revenge, but&mdash;the
guards?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuddled with drink,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I took care of
that. Don&#8217;t waste time asking questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Duke will be in a fearful rage with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>His eyes grew hard. &#8220;Am I a child that I should
tremble when Cumberland frowns?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll make you pay for this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A fig for the payment!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll lose favour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll teach the sullen beast to refuse me one. The
boots next.&#8221;</p>
<p>He put on the wig and hat for me, arranged the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
muffler over the lower part of my face, and fastened
the cloak.</p>
<p>&#8220;The watchword for the night is &#8216;Culloden.&#8217; You
should have no trouble in passing. I needn&#8217;t tell you
to be bold,&#8221; he finished dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not forget this,&#8221; I told him.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s as you please,&#8221; he answered carelessly.
&#8220;I ask no gratitude. I&#8217;m settling a debt,
or rather two&mdash;one due Cumberland and the other
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, I&#8217;ll remember.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, all right. Hope we&#8217;ll have the pleasure of
renewing our little game some day. Better take to
the hills or the water. You&#8217;ll find the roads strictly
guarded. Don&#8217;t let yourself get killed, my friend.
The pleasure of running you through I reserve for
myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>I passed out of the hut into the night. The
troopers who guarded the bothy were in either the
stupid or the uproarious stage of their drink. Two of
them sang a catch of a song, and I wondered that they
had not already brought down on them the officer of
the day. I passed them carelessly with a nod. One
of them bawled out, &#8220;The watchword!&#8221; and I gave
them &#8220;Culloden.&#8221; Toward the skirts of the village I
sauntered, fear dogging my footsteps; and when I was
once clear of the houses, cut across a meadow toward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
the shore, wary as a panther, eyes and ears alert for
signals of danger. Without mishap I reached the
sound, beat my way up the sand links for a mile or
more, and saw a boat cruising in the moonlight off
shore. I gave the whaup&#8217;s cry, and across the water
came an answer.</p>
<p>Five minutes later I was helping the gillie in the
boat pull across to Raasay. When half way over we
rested on our oars for a breathing space and I asked
the news, the rug-headed kerne shot me with the dismal
tidings that Malcolm Macleod and Creagh, rowing
to Skyes for a conference with Captain Roy, had
fallen into the hands of the troopers waiting for
them among the sand dunes. He had but one bit
of comfort in his budget, and that was &#8220;ta yellow-haired
Sassenach body wass leaving this morning
with Raasay hersel&#8217; and Murdoch.&#8221; At least I
had some assurance that my undertaking had secured
the safety of the Prince, even though three staunch
men were on their way to their death by reason
of it.</p>
<p>Once landed on Raasay, I made up the brae to the
great house. Lights were still burning, and when I
got close &#8217;twas easy to be seen that terror and confusion
filled it. Whimpering, white-faced women and
wailing bairns ran hither and thither blindly. Somewhere
in the back part of the house the bagpipes were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
soughing a dismal kind of dirge. Fierce-eyed men
with mops of shock hair were gathered into groups of
cursing clansmen. Through them all I pushed my
way in to Aileen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE LITTLE GOD HAS AN INNINGS</h3>
</div>

<p>By the great fireplace she stood, hands clasped,
head upturned as in prayer. The lips moved
silently in the petition of her heart. I saw in
profile a girl&#8217;s troubled face charged with mystery, a
slim, tall, weary figure all in white against the flame, a
cheek&#8217;s pure oval, the tense curve of a proud neck, a
mass of severely snodded russet hair. So I recalled
her afterward, picture of desolation seeking comfort,
but at the moment when I blundered on her my
presence seemed profanity and no time was found for
appraisement. Abashed I came to a halt, and was for
tiptoeing back to the door; but hearing me she
turned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kenneth!&#8221; she cried, and stood with parted lips.
Then, &#8220;They told me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That I was taken. True, but I escaped. How, I
will tell you later. The Prince&mdash; Is he safe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For the present, yes. A lugger put in this morning
belonging to some smugglers. In it he sailed for
the mainland with Ronald and Murdoch. You will
have heard the bad news,&#8221; she cried.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That Malcolm, Creagh, and Donald are taken?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Flora, too. She iss to be sent to London for
assisting in the escape of the Prince. And so are the
others.&#8221;</p>
<p>I fell silent, deep in thought, and shortly came to a
resolution.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aileen, the Highlands are no place for me. I am
a stranger here. Every clachan in which I am seen
is full of danger for me. To-morrow I am for
London.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To save Malcolm,&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I can. Raasay cannot go. He must stay
to protect his clansmen. Murdoch is a fugitive and
his speech would betray him in an hour. Remains
only I.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not? After &#8216;the &#8217;15&#8217; women&#8217;s tears saved
many a life. And I too have friends. Sir Robert
Volney, evil man as he iss, would move heaven and
earth to save my brother.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was much truth in what she said. In these
days of many executions a pardon was to be secured
less by merit than by the massing of influence, and I
knew of no more potent influence than a beautiful
woman in tears. Together we might be able to do
something for our friends. But there was the long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
journey through a hostile country to be thought of,
and the probability that we might never reach our
destination in freedom. I could not tell the blessed
child that her presence would increase threefold my
chances of being taken, nor indeed was that a thing
that held weight with me. Sure, there was her reputation
to be considered, but the company of a maid
would obviate that difficulty.</p>
<p>Ronald returned next day, and I laid the matter
before him. He was extraordinarily loath to let
Aileen peril herself, but on the other hand he could
not let Malcolm suffer the penalty of the law without
making an effort on his behalf. Raasay was tied
hand and foot by the suspicions of the government
and was forced to consent to leave the matter in our
hands. He made only the one stipulation, that we
should go by way of Edinburgh and take his Aunt
Miss MacBean with us as chaperone.</p>
<p>We embarked on the smuggler next day for the
Long Island and were landed at Stornoway. After a
dreary wait of over a week at this place we took shipping
on a brig bound for Edinburgh. Along the
north coast of Scotland, through the Pentland Firth,
and down the east shore <i>The Lewis</i> scudded. It
seemed that we were destined to have an uneventful
voyage till one day we sighted a revenue cutter which
gave chase. As we had on board <i>The Lewis</i> a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
cargo of illicit rum, the brig being in the contraband
trade, there was nothing for it but an incontinent
flight. For some hours our fate hung in the balance,
but night coming on we slipped away in the darkness.
The Captain, however, being an exceedingly timid
man for one in his position, refused absolutely to put
into the Leith Road lest his retreat should be cut off.
Instead he landed us near Wemyss Castle, some distance
up the coast, and what was worse hours before
the dawn had cleared and in a pelting rain.</p>
<p>I wrapped Volney&#8217;s cloak around Aileen and we took
the southward road, hoping to come on some village
where we might find shelter. The situation might be
thought one of extreme discomfort. There were we
three&mdash;Aileen, her maid, and I&mdash;sloshing along the
running road in black darkness with the dreary
splashing of the rain to emphasize our forlorn condition.
Over unknown paths we travelled on precarious
errand. Yet I for one never took a journey that
pleased me more. The mirk night shut out all others,
and a fair face framed in a tartan shawl made my
whole world for me. A note of tenderness not to be
defined crept into our relationship. There was a
sweet disorder in her hair and more than once the
wind whaffed it into my face. In walking our fingers
touched once and again; greatly daring, mine slipped
over hers, and so like children we went hand in hand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
An old romancer tells quaintly in one of his tales
how Love made himself of the party, and so it was
with us that night. I found my answer at last without
words. While the heavens wept our hearts sang.
The wine of love ran through me in exquisite thrills.
Every simple word she spoke went to my heart like
sweetest music, and every unconscious touch of her
hand was a caress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tired, Aileen?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;There is my arm to
lean on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, but presently her ringers rested on
my sleeve.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;T will be daylight soon, and see! the scudding
clouds are driving away the rain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Kenneth,&#8221; she answered, and sighed softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will think I am a sad blunderer to bring you
tramping through the night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will be thinking you are the good friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>Too soon the grey dawn broke, for at the first
glimmer my love disengaged herself from my arm. I
looked shyly at her, and the glory of her young
beauty filled me. Into her cheeks the raw morning
wind had whipped the red, had flushed her like a
radiant Diana. The fresh breeze had outlined her
figure clear as she struggled against it, and the billowing
sail was not more graceful than her harmonious
lines.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></p>
<p>Out of the sea the sun rose a great ball of flaming
fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;A good omen for the success of our journey,&#8221; I
cried. &#8220;Look!</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>

</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;The good God grant it prove so, Kenneth, for
Malcolm and for all our friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>After all youth has its day and will not be denied.
We were on an anxious undertaking of more than
doubtful outcome, but save when we remembered to
be sober we trod the primrose path.</p>
<p>We presently came to a small village where we had
breakfast at the inn. For long we had eaten nothing
but the musty fare of the brig, and I shall never forget
with what merry daffing we enjoyed the crisp
oaten cake, the buttered scones, the marmalade, and
the ham and eggs. After we had eaten Aileen went
to her room to snatch some hours sleep while I
made arrangements for a cart to convey us on our
way.</p>
<p>A wimpling burn ran past the end of the inn
garden, and here on a rustic bench I found my comrade
when I sought her some hours later. The sun
was shining on her russet-hair. Her chin was in her
hands, her eyes on the gurgling brook. The memories
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
of the night must still have been thrilling her,
for she was singing softly that most exquisite of love
songs &#8220;Annie Laurie.&#8221;</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>

<p>Her voice trembled a little, and I took up the song.</p>

<p>At my first words she gave a little start, her lips
parted, her head came up prettily to attention, and
though I could not see them I was ready to vow that
she listened with shining eyes. Softly her breath
came and went. I trod nearer as I sang.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Aileen, if I might&mdash;if I only had the right!
Won&#8217;t you give it me, dear heart?&#8221;</p>
<p>In the long silence my pulse stopped, then throbbed
like an aching tooth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m waiting, Aileen. It is to be yes or no?&#8221;</p>
<p>The shy blue eyes met mine for an instant before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
they fluttered groundward. I could scarce make out
the low sweet music of her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Kenneth, not now! You forget&mdash;my brother
Malcolm&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I forget everything but this, that I love you.&#8221;</p>
<p>In her cheeks was being fought the war of the
roses, with Lancaster victorious. The long-lashed
eyes came up to meet mine bravely, love lucent in
them. Our glances married; in those clear Highland
lochs of hers I was sunk fathoms deep.</p>
<p>&#8220;Truly, Kenneth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From the head to the heel of you, Aileen, lass.
For you I would die, and that is all there is about it,&#8221;
I cried, wildly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, take me, Kenneth! I am all yours.
Of telling love there will be many ways in the Gaelic,
and I am thinking them all at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>And this is the plain story of how the great happiness
came into Kenneth Montagu&#8217;s life, and how,
though all unworthy, he won for his own the daughter
of Raasay.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE AFTERMATH</h3>
</div>

<p>At Edinburgh we received check one. Aileen&#8217;s
aunt had left for the Highlands the week before
in a fine rage because the Duke of Cumberland,
who had foisted himself upon her unwilling
hospitality, had eaten her out of house and home,
then departing had borne away with him her cherished
household <i>penates</i> to the value of some hundred
pounds. Years later Major Wolfe told me with
twinkling eyes the story of how the fiery little lady
came to him with her tale of woe. If she did not go
straight to the dour Duke it was because he was already
out of the city and beyond her reach. Into
Wolfe&#8217;s quarters she bounced, rage and suspicion
speaking eloquent in her manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hech, sir! Where have ye that Dutch Prince of
yours?&#8221; she demanded of Wolfe, her keen eyes ranging
over him.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Pon honour, madam, I have not him secreted on
my person,&#8221; returned the Major, gravely turning inside
out his pockets for her.</p>
<p>The spirited old lady glowered at him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s ill setting ye to be sae humoursome,&#8221; she told
him frankly. &#8220;It wad be better telling ye to answer
ceevilly a ceevil question, my birkie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I can be of any service, madam&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph, service! And that&#8217;s just it, my mannie.
The ill-faured tykes hae rampaigned through the
house and taen awa&#8217; my bonnie silver tea service that
I hae scoured every Monday morning for thirty-seven
years come Michelmas, forby the fine Holland linen
that my father, guid carefu&#8217; man, brought frae the
continent his nainsel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry! Hear till him,&#8221; she snorted. &#8220;Muckle
guid your sorrow will do me unless&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; her voice
fell to a wheedling cajolery&mdash;&#8220;you just be a guid
laddie and get me back my linen and the silver.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Duke has a partiality for fine bed linen, and
quaint silver devices are almost a mania with him.
Perhaps some of your other possessions&#8221;&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;His Dutch officers ate me out of house and home.
They took awa&#8217; eight sacks of the best lump sugar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The army is in need of sugar. I fear it is not recoverable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss MacBean had a way of affecting deafness when
the occasion suited her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eih, sir! Were you saying you wad see it was
recovered? And my silver set wi&#8217; twenty solid teaspoons,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
forby the linen?&#8221; she asked anxiously, her
hand to her ear.</p>
<p>Wolfe smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear the Duke&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ou ay, I ken fine you fear him. He&#8217;s gurly
enough, Guid kens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was about to say, madam, that I fear the Duke
will regard them as spoils from the enemy not to be
given up.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Major was right. Miss MacBean might as well
have saved her breath to cool her porridge, for the
Duke carried her possessions to London despite her
remonstrances. Five years later as I was passing by
a pawnbroker&#8217;s shop on a mean street in London Miss
MacBean&#8217;s teapot with its curious device of a winged
dragon for a spout caught my eye in the window.
The shopkeeper told me that it had been sold him by
a woman of the demi-monde who had formerly been
a mistress of the Duke of Cumberland. She said that
it was a present from his Royal Highness, who had
taken the silver service from the house of a fiery rebel
lady in the north.</p>
<p>Our stay in the Scottish capital was of the shortest.
In the early morning we went knocking at the door
of Miss MacBean&#8217;s house. All day I kept under
cover and in the darkness of night we slipped out of
the city southwest bound. Of that journey, its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
sweet comradeship, its shy confidences, its perpetual
surprises for each of us in discovering the other, I
have no time nor mind to tell. The very danger
which was never absent from our travel drew us into a
closer friendliness. Was there an option between two
roads, or the question of the desirability of putting up
at a certain inn, our heads came together to discuss it.
Her pretty confidence in me was touching in the extreme.
To have her hold me a Captain Greatheart
made my soul glad, even though I knew my measure
did not fit the specifications by a mile. Her trust in
me was less an incense to my vanity than a spur to
my manhood.</p>
<p>The mere joy of living flooded my blood with happiness
in those days. I vow it made me a better man
to breathe the same air as she, to hear the lilt of her
merry laugh and the low music of her sweet voice.
Not a curve in that dimpled cheek I did not love; not
a ripple in the russet hair my hungry eyes had not
approved. When her shy glance fell on me I rode in
the sunshine of bluest sky. If by chance her hand
touched mine, my veins leaped with the wine of it.
Of such does the happiness of youth consist.</p>
<p>&#8217;Tis strange how greedy love is in its early days of
the past from which it has been excluded, how jealous
sometimes of the point of contact with other lives in
the unknown years which have gone to make up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
the rungs of the ladder of life. I was never tired of
hearing of her childhood on the braes of Raasay:
how she guddled for mountain trout in the burn with
her brother Murdoch or hung around his neck chains
of daisies in childish glee. And she&mdash; Faith, she
drew me out with shy questions till that part of my
life which would bear telling must have been to her a
book learned by rote.</p>
<p>Yet there were times when we came near to misunderstanding
of each other. The dear child had
been brought up in a houseful of men, her mother
having died while she was yet an infant, and she was
in some ways still innocent as a babe. The circumstances
of our journey put her so much in my power
that I, not to take advantage of the situation, sometimes
held myself with undue stiffness toward her
when my every impulse was to tenderness. Perhaps
it might be that we rode through woodland in the
falling dusk while the nesting birds sang madrigals of
love. Longing with all my heart to touch but the hem
of her gown, I would yet ride with a wooden face set
to the front immovably, deaf to her indirect little appeals
for friendliness. Presently, ashamed of my
gruffness, I would yield to the sweetness of her
charm, good resolutions windwood scattered, and woo
her with a lover&#8217;s ardour till the wild-rose deepened in
her cheek.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Were you ever in love before, Kennie?&#8221; she
asked me once, twisting at a button of my coat. We
were drawing near Manchester and had let the
postillion drive on with the coach, while we loitered
hand in hand through the forest of Arden. The
azure sky was not more blue than the eyes which
lifted shyly to mine, nor the twinkling stars which
would soon gaze down on us one half so bright.</p>
<p>I laughed happily. &#8220;Once&mdash;in a boy&#8217;s way&mdash;a
thousand years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And were you caring for her&mdash;much?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, vastly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And she&mdash;wass she loving you too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More than tongue could tell, she made me believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I am not wondering at that,&#8221; said my heart&#8217;s
desire. &#8220;Of course she would be loving you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Twas Aileen&#8217;s way to say the thing she thought,
directly, in headlong Highland fashion. Of finesse
she used none. She loved me (oh, a thousand times
more than I deserved!) and that was all there was
about it. To be ashamed of her love or to hide it
never, I think, occurred to her. What more natural
then than that others should think of me as she did?</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; I said dryly. &#8220;But in the end my
sweetheart, plighted to me for all eternity, had to
choose betwixt her lover and something she had

which he much desired. She sighed, deliberated long&mdash;full
five seconds I vow&mdash;and in end played traitor
to love. She was desolated to lose me, but the
alternative was not to be endured. She sacrificed me
for a raspberry tart. So was shattered young love&#8217;s
first dream. &#8217;Tis my only consolation that I snatched
the tart and eat it as I ran. Thus Phyllis lost both her
lover and her portion. Ah, those brave golden days!
The world, an unexplored wonder, lay at my feet.
She was seven, I was nine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh.&#8221; There was an odd little note of relief in the
velvet voice that seemed to reproach me for a brute.
I was forever forgetting that the ways of &#8217;Toinette
Westerleigh were not the ways of Aileen Macleod.</p>
<p>The dying sun flooded the topmost branches of the
forest foliage. My eyes came round to the aureole
which was their usual magnet.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the sun catches it &#8217;tis shot with glints of
gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is indeed very beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In cloudy weather &#8217;tis a burnished bronze.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at me in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bronze! Surely you are meaning green?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not I, bronze. Again you might swear it
russet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That will be in the autumn when they are turning
colour just before the fall.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, that is when you have it neatly snodded and
the firelight plays about your head.&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed, flushing. &#8220;You will be forever at
your foolishness, Kenn. I thought you meant the
tree tips.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the truth foolishness?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a lover, Kennie. Other folks don&#8217;t see
that when they look at me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Other folks are blind,&#8221; I maintained, stoutly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you see all that I will be sure that what they say
is true and love is blind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The wise man is the lover. He sees clear for the
first time in his life. The sun shines for him&mdash;and
her. For them the birds sing and the flowers bloom.
For them the world was made. They&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whiles talk blethers,&#8221; she laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they do,&#8221; I admitted. &#8220;And there again is
another sign of wisdom. Your ponderous fool talks
pompous sense always. He sees life in only one
facet. Your lover sees its many sides, its infinite
variety. He can laugh and weep; his imagination
lights up dry facts with whimsical fancies; he dives
through the crust of conventionality to the realities of
life. &#8217;Tis the lover keeps this old world young. The
fire of youth, of eternal laughing youth, runs flaming
through his blood. His days are radiant, his nights
enchanted.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am thinking you quite a poet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was there ever a better subject for a poem?
Life would be poetry writ into action if all men were
lovers&mdash;and all women Aileens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Kenneth! This fine talk I do not understand.
It&#8217;s sheer nonsense to tell such idle clavers
about me. Am I not just a plain Highland lassie, as
unskilled in flattering speeches as in furbelows and
patches? Gin you will play me a spring on the pipes
I&#8217;ll maybe can dance you the fling, but of French
minuets I have small skill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Call me dreamer if you will. By Helen&#8217;s glove,
your dreamer might be the envy of kings. Since I
have known you life has taken a different hue. One
lives for years without joy, pain, colour, all things
toned to the dull monochrome of gray, and then one
day the contact with another soul quickens one to
renewed life, to more eager unselfish living. Never so
bright a sun before, never so beautiful a moon. &#8217;Tis
true, Aileen. No fear but one, that Fate, jealous, may
snatch my love from me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her laughter dashed my heroics; yet I felt, too,
that back of her smiles there was belief.</p>
<p>&#8220;I dare say. At the least I will have heard it before.
The voice iss Jacob&#8217;s voice, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>I blushed, remembering too late that my text and
its application were both Volney&#8217;s.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis true, even if Jacob said it first. If a man is
worth his salt love must purify him. Sure it must. I
am a better man for knowing you.&#8221;</p>
<p>A shy wonder filled her eyes; thankfulness too was
there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet you are a man that has fought battles and
known life, and I am only an ignorant girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>I lifted her hand and kissed it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are my queen, and I am your most loyal and
devoted servant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For always, Kenn? When you are meeting the
fine ladies of London will you love a Highland lassie
that cannot make eyes and swear choicely?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forever and a day, dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aileen referred to the subject again two hours later
when we arose from the table at the Manchester
ordinary. It was her usual custom to retire to her
room immediately after eating. To-night when I
escorted her to the door she stood for a moment drawing
patterns on the lintel with her fan. A fine blush
touched her cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you meaning all that, Kennie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All what, dear heart?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&mdash;nonsense&mdash;in the forest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every bit of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her fan spelt Kenneth on the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes,&#8221; she went on softly, &#8220;a fancy is built
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
on moonlight and laughing eyes and opportunity. It
iss like sunshine in winter on Raasay&mdash;just for an hour
and then the mists fall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For our love there will be no mists.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Kenn, you think so now, but afterward, when
you take up again your London life, and I cannot play
the lady of fashion, when you weary of my simpleness
and are wishing me back among the purple heather
hills?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That will be never, unless I wish myself there with
you. I am no London Mohawk like Volney. To
tramp the heather after muircocks or to ride to hounds
is more my fancy. The Macaronis and I came long
since to the parting of the ways. I am for a snug
home in the country with the woman I love.&#8221;</p>
<p>I stepped to the table, filled a glass with wine, and
brought it to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, love! We will drink together. How is it
old Ben Jonson hath it?</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;Drink, sweetheart.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></p>
<p>She tasted, then I drained the glass and let it fall
from my fingers to shiver on the floor.</p>
<p>Before we parted Aileen had one more word for me,
&#8220;Kennie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear heart,&#8221; I cried, and was back at her side
in a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you said in the woods&mdash;I am knowing it all
true. It is great foolishness, but my heart is singing
the same song,&#8221; and with that she whipped the door to
in my face.</p>
<p>I sauntered into the common room, found a
seat by the fireplace, and let my eye wander over
the company. There were present some half dozen
yokels, the vicar&#8217;s curate, a country blood or two,
and a little withered runt of a man in fustian
with a weazened face like a wrinkled pippin. The
moment I clapped eyes on him there came to my
mind the dim recollection of a former acquaintance
and the prescient fear of an impending danger. That
I had seen him I was ready to take oath, yet I could
not put my finger upon the circumstances. But the
worst of it was that the old fellow recognized me,
unless I were much mistaken, for his eyes never left
me from the first.</p>
<p>From my mother I have inherited a Highland
jauntiness which comes stealing over me when sobriety
would set me better. Let the situation be a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
different one, uncertain of solution, with heads tipping
in the balance, and an absurd spirit of recklessness
straightway possesses me. But now, with this dear
child on my hands, carelessness and I were far apart
as the poles. Anxiety gripped me, and I sweated
blood. Yet I must play the careless traveller, be full
of good stories, unperturbed on the surface and apparently
far from alarm. I began to overdo the part,
recognized the fact, and grew savage at myself. Trying
to conciliate him, I was free with the ale, and
again overdid it.</p>
<p>He drank my ale and listened to my stories, but he
sat cocking on his seat like an imp of mischief. I
rattled on, insouciant and careless to all appearances,
but in reality my heart like lead. Behind my smiling
lips I cursed him up hill and down dale. Lard, his
malicious grin was a thing to rile the gods! More
than once I wake up in the night from dreaming that
his scrawny hand was clapping the darbies on my
wrists.</p>
<p>When we were ready to start next morning the
post boy let me know that one of the horses had gone
lame. Here was a pretty pickle. I pished and
pshawed, but in the end had to scour the town to find
another in its place. &#8217;Twas well on toward noon
when the boy and I returned to the ordinary with a
nag that would serve.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></p>
<p>Of other lovers I have scant knowledge, but the
one I know was wont to cherish the memory of things
his love had said and how she had said them; with
what a pretty tilt to her chin, with what a daring shyness
of the eyes, with what a fine colour and impetuous
audacity she had done this or looked that. He
was wont in advance to plan out conversations, to decide
that he would tell her some odd brain fancy and
watch her while he told it. Many an hour he spent
in the fairy land of imagination; many a one he
dreamed away in love castles built of fancied rambles
in enchanted woods, of sweet talks in which he always
said and did the right thing; destined alas!
never to pass from mind to speech, for if ever tongue
essayed the telling it faltered some fatuous abortion as
little like love&#8217;s dream as Caliban resembled Ariel.
Fresh from the brave world of day-dreams, still smiling
happily from some whimsical conceit as well as
with anticipation of Aileen&#8217;s gladness at sight of me, I
passed through the courtyard and into the ordinary.</p>
<p>A hubbub at the foot of the stairway attracted me.
A gaping crowd was gathered there about three central
figures. My weasened pippin-face of the malicious
grin was one of them; a broad-shouldered,
fair-faced and very much embarrassed young officer in
the King&#8217;s uniform stood beside him; and from the
stairway some three steps up Aileen, plainly frightened,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
fronted them and answered questions in her
broken English.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am desolated to distress you, madam,&#8221; the boy
officer was saying, &#8220;but this man has laid an information
with me that there is a rebel in your party, one
who was in Manchester with the Pretender&#8217;s force
some months since. It will be necessary that I have
speech with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There iss no rebel with me, sir. The gentleman
with whom I travel iss of most approved loyalty,&#8221; she
faltered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! He will no doubt be able to make that
clear to me. May I ask where he is at present?&#8221;</p>
<p>Aileen went white as snow. Her distress was apparent
to all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir, I do entreat you to believe that what I say iss
true,&#8221; she cried whitely.</p>
<p>The little rat in fustian broke out screaming that he
would swear to me among ten thousand: as to the
girl she must be the rebel&#8217;s accomplice, his mistress
mayhap. Aileen, her big, anxious eyes fixed on the
officer, shrank back against the stair rail at her accuser&#8217;s
word. The lad commanded him sharply to be
quiet, but with the utmost respect let Aileen understand
that he must have talk with me.</p>
<p>All this one swift glance had told me, and at this
opportune moment I sauntered up, Volney&#8217;s snuff-box
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
in my hand. If the doubt possessed me as to how the
devil I was to win free from this accusation, I trust no
shadow of fear betrayed itself in my smirking face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Egad, here&#8217;s a gathering of the clans. Hope I&#8217;m
not <i>de trop</i>,&#8221; I simpered.</p>
<p>The lieutenant bowed to me with evident relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary, sir, if you are the gentleman
travelling with this lady you are the desired complement
to our party. There has been some doubt expressed
as to you. This man here claims to have recognized
you as one of the Pretender&#8217;s army; says he
was present when you bought provisions for a
troop of horsemen during the rebel invasion of this
town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Slife, perhaps I&#8217;m Charles Stuart himself,&#8221; I
shrugged.</p>
<p>&#8220;I swear to him. I swear to him,&#8221; screamed fustian.</p>
<p>On my soul merely to look at the man gave me a
nausea. His white malevolence fair scunnered me.</p>
<p>I adjusted Volney&#8217;s eye-glass with care and looked
the fellow over with a candid interest, much as your
scientist examines a new specimen.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the plague! Is this rusty old last year&#8217;s
pippin an evidence against me? Rot me, he&#8217;s a pretty
scrub on which to father a charge against a gentleman,
Lud, his face is a lie. No less!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></p>
<p>&#8220;May I ask your name, sir, and your business in
this part of the country?&#8221; said the lieutenant.</p>
<p>Some impulse&mdash;perhaps the fact that I was wearing
his clothes&mdash;put it into my head to borrow Volney&#8217;s
name. There was risk that the lad might have
met the baronet, but that was a contingency which
must be ventured. It brought him to like a shot
across a lugger&#8217;s bows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir Robert Volney, the friend of the Prince,&#8221; he
said, patently astonished.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Prince has that honour,&#8221; I smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pray pardon my insistence. Orders from headquarters,&#8221;
says he apologetically.</p>
<p>I waved aside his excuses peevishly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sink me, Sir Robert Volney should be well
enough known not to be badgered by every country
booby with a king&#8217;s commission. Lard, I vow I&#8217;ll
have a change when Fritz wears the crown.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that I turned on my heel in a simulation of
petty anger, offered my arm to Aileen, and marched
up the stairs with her. My manner and my speech
were full of flowered compliments to her, of insolence
to the young gentleman below, for there is nothing
more galling to a man&#8217;s pride than to be ignored.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas the only way,&#8221; I said to Aileen when the
door was closed on us above. &#8220;&#8217;Tis a shame to flout
an honest young gentleman so, but in such fashion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
the macaroni would play the part. Had I stayed to
talk with him he might have asked for my proof.
We&#8217;re well out of the affair.&#8221;</p>
<p>But we were not out of it yet. I make no doubt
that no sooner was my back turned than the little rat
in fustian, his mind set on a possible reward, was
plucking at the lad&#8217;s sleeve with suggestions and
doubts. In any case there came presently a knock at
the door. I opened. The boy officer was there with
a red face obstinately set.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir, I must trouble you again,&#8221; he said icily.
&#8220;You say you are Sir Robert Volney. I must ask
you for proofs.&#8221;</p>
<p>At once I knew that I had overdone my part. It
had been better to have dealt with this youth courteously;
but since I had chosen my part, I must
play it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Proofs,&#8221; I cried blackly. &#8220;Do you think I carry
proofs of my identity for every country bumpkin to
read? Sink me, &#8217;tis an outrage.&#8221;</p>
<p>He flushed, but hung doggedly to his point.</p>
<p>&#8220;You gain nothing by insulting me, Sir Robert. I
may be only a poor line officer and you one high in
power, but by Heaven! I&#8217;m as good a man as you,&#8221;
cried the boy; then rapped out, &#8220;I&#8217;ll see your
papers, if you have me broke for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>My papers! An inspiration shot into my brain.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
When Volney had substituted for me at Portree he
had given me a pass through the lines, made out in
his name and signed by the Duke of Cumberland, in
order that I might present it if challenged. Hitherto
I had not been challenged, and indeed I had forgotten
the existence of it, but now&mdash; I fished out
the sheet of parchment and handed it to the officer.
His eye ran over the passport, and he handed it back
with a flushed face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have to offer a thousand apologies for troubling
you, Sir Robert. This paper establishes your identity
beyond doubt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hope you&#8217;re quite satisfied,&#8221; I said with vast
irony.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, just one more question. The lady travelling
with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>I watched him silently.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is from the Highlands, is she not?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure &#8217;tis sufficient if Sir Robert Volney
vouches for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And of course the fact that she travels in his
company&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>My answer was a yawn, half stifled behind my
hand. The lad glared at me, in a rage at me for my
insolence and at himself for his boyish inability to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
cope with it. Then he swung on his heel and
stamped down-stairs. Five years later I met him at a
dinner given by a neighbour of mine in the country,
and I took occasion then to explain to him my intolerable
conduct. Many a laugh we have since had
over it.</p>
<p>We reached London on a dismal Wednesday when
the rain was pouring down in sheets. Aileen I took
at once to our town house that she might be with
Cloe, though I expected to put up with my old nurse
in another part of the city. I leave you to conceive
the surprise of Charles and my sister when we
dropped in on them.</p>
<p>The news they had for us was of the worst. Every
week witnessed the execution of some poor Jacobites
and the arrival of a fresh batch to take their place in the
prisons. The Scotch Lords Balmerino, Cromartie and
Kilmarnock were already on trial and their condemnation
was a foregone conclusion. The thirst for blood
was appalling and not at all glutted by the numerous
executions that had already occurred. &#8217;Twas indeed
for me a most dismal home-coming.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>A REPRIEVE!</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;My Lord of March, is Arthur Lord Balmerino
guilty of High Treason?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lord March, youngest peer of the realm,
profligate and scoundrel, laid his hand on the place
where his heart ought to have been and passed judgment
unctuously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guilty, upon my honour.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Lord High Steward repeated the same question
to each of the peers in order of their age and received
from each the same answer. As it became plain that
the prisoner at the bar was to be convicted the gentleman-gaoler
gradually turned the edge of his axe
toward Balmerino, whose manner was nonchalant
and scornful. When the vote had been polled my
Lord bowed to the judges with dignity and remarked,
&#8220;I am sorry to have taken up so much of your time
without avail, my lords. If I pleaded &#8216;not guilty&#8217; my
principal reason was that the ladies might not miss
their show.&#8221; Shortly afterward he was ushered out of
Westminster Hall to his carriage.</p>
<p>From the view-point of the whigs Balmerino was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
undoubtedly guilty as Lucifer and not all the fair play
in the world could have saved him from Tower Hill.
He was twice a rebel, having been pardoned for his
part in &#8220;the &#8217;15,&#8221; and &#8217;twas not to be expected that
so hardened an offender would again receive mercy.
But at the least he might have been given courtesy,
and that neither he nor his two fellows, Kilmarnock
and Cromartie, did at all receive. The crown lawyers
to the contrary took an unmanly delight in girding
and snapping at the captives whom the fortune of war
had put in their power. Monstrous charges were
trumped up that could not be substantiated, even the
Lord High Steward descending to vituperation.</p>
<p>Horry Walpole admitted Balmerino to be the bravest
man he had ever seen. Throughout the trial his demeanour
had been characteristic of the man, bold and
intrepid even to the point of bravado. The stout old
lord conversed with the official axe-bearer and felt the
edge of the ominous instrument with the unconcern
of any chance spectator. There was present a little
boy who could see nothing for the crowd and Balmerino
alone was unselfish enough to think of him. He
made a seat for the child beside himself and took care
that he missed nothing of the ceremony. When the
Solicitor-General, whose brother, Secretary Murray,
had saved his own life by turning evidence against
Balmerino, went up to the Scotch Lord and asked him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
insolently how he dared give the peers so much
trouble, Balmerino drew himself up with dignity and
asked, &#8220;Who is this person?&#8221; Being told that it was
Mr. Murray, &#8220;Oh!&#8221; he answered smiling, &#8220;Mr. Murray!
I am glad to see you. I have been with several
of your relations; the good lady your mother
was of great use to us at Perth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Through the crowd I elbowed my way and waited
for the three condemned Scotch lords to pass into
their carriages. Balmerino, bluff and soldierly, led
the way; next came the tall and elegant Kilmarnock;
Lord Cromartie, plainly nervous and depressed,
brought up the rear. Balmerino recognized me,
nodded almost imperceptibly, but of course gave no
other sign of knowing the gawky apprentice who
gaped at him along with a thousand others. Some one
in the crowd cried out, &#8220;Which is Balmerino?&#8221;
The old lord turned courteously, and said with a bow,
&#8220;I am Balmerino.&#8221; At the door of the coach he
stopped to shake hands with his fellow-sufferers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry that I alone cannot pay the debt, gentlemen.
But after all &#8217;tis but what we owe to nature
sooner or later, the common debt of all. I bear in
mind what Sir Walter Raleigh wrote the night before
his head paid forfeit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Murray drags out a miserable life despised by
all, but we go to our God with clean hands. By St.
Andrew, the better lot is ours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think of my poor wife and eight fatherless
bairns,&#8221; said Cromartie sadly.</p>
<p>Rough Arthur Elphinstone&#8217;s comforting hand fell
on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;A driech outlook, my friend. You must commend
them to the God of orphans if the worst befalls.
As for us&mdash; Well, in the next world we will not
be tried by a whig jury.&#8221;</p>
<p>Balmerino stepped into the coach which was waiting
to convey him to the Tower. The gentleman-gaoler
followed with the official axe, the edge of which
still pointed toward its victim. He must have handled
it carelessly in getting into the carriage, for I heard
Balmerino bark out,</p>
<p>&#8220;Take care, man, or you&#8217;ll break my shins with
that d&mdash;&mdash;d axe.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were the last words I ever heard from his lips.
The door slammed and the coach drove away to the
prison, from which my Lord came forth only to meet
the headsman and his block.</p>
<p>Sadly I made my way towards the city through the
jostling crowds of sightseers. Another batch of captives
from the North was to pass through the town
that day on their way to prison, and a fleering rabble
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
surged to and fro about the streets of London in gala
dress, boisterous, jovial, pitiless. From high to low
by common consent the town made holiday. Above
the common ruck, in windows hired for the occasion,
the fashionable world, exuding patronage and perfume,
sat waiting for the dreary procession to pass. In the
windows opposite where I found standing room a
party from the West End made much talk and laughter.
In the group I recognized Antoinette Westerleigh,
Sir James Craven, and Topham Beauclerc.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slitterkins! I couldn&#8217;t get a seat at Westminster
Hall this morning for love or money,&#8221; pouted
Mistress Westerleigh. &#8220;&#8217;Tis pity you men can&#8217;t find
room for a poor girl to see the show.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Egad, there might as well have been no rebellion
at all,&#8221; said Beauclerc dryly. &#8220;Still, you can go to
see their heads chopped off. &#8217;Twill be some compensation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;ll go, Selwyn,&#8221; said Craven to that
gentleman, who with Volney had just joined the
group.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so, and to make amends I&#8217;ll go to see
them sewn on again,&#8221; returned Selwyn.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear you want the High Steward&#8217;s wand for a
memento,&#8221; said Beauclerc.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not I,&#8221; returned Selwyn. &#8220;I did, but egad! he
behaved so like an attorney the first day and so like a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
pettifogger the second that I wouldn&#8217;t take the wand
to light my fire with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here they come, sink me!&#8221; cried Craven, and
craned forward to get a first glimpse of the wretched
prisoners.</p>
<p>First came four wagon-loads of the wounded, huddled
together thick as shrimps, their pallid faces and forlorn
appearance a mute cry for sympathy. The mob
roared like wild beasts, poured out maledictions on
their unkempt heads, hurled stones and sticks at them
amid furious din and clamour. At times it seemed as
if the prisoners would be torn from the hands of their
guard by the excited mob. Scarce any name was
found too vile with which to execrate these unfortunate
gentlemen who had been guilty of no crime but
excessive loyalty.</p>
<p>Some of the captives were destined for the New
Prison in Southwark, others for Newgate, and a few
for the Marshalsea. Those of the prisoners who were
able to walk were handcuffed together in couples,
with the exception of a few of the officers who rode
on horseback bound hand and foot. Among the
horsemen I easily recognized Malcolm Macleod, who
sat erect, dour, scornful, his strong face set like a vise,
looking neither to the right nor the left. Another
batch of foot prisoners followed. Several of the poor
fellows were known to me, including Leath, Chadwick,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
and the lawyer Morgan. My roving eye fell on
Creagh and Captain Roy shackled together.</p>
<p>From the window above a piercing cry of agony
rang out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tony! Tony!&#8221;</p>
<p>Creagh slewed round his head and threw up his
free hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Toinette!&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>But Miss Westerleigh had fainted, and Volney was
already carrying her from the window with the flicker
of a grim smile on his face. I noticed with relief
that Craven had disappeared from sight.</p>
<p>My relief was temporary. When I turned to leave
I found my limbs clogged with impedimenta. To
each arm hung a bailiff, and a third clung like a leech
to my legs. Some paces distant Sir James Craven
stood hulloing them to the sport with malign pleasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;To it, fustian breeches! Yoho, yoho! There&#8217;s
ten guineas in it for each of you and two hundred for
me. &#8217;Slife, down with him, you red-haired fellow!
Throw him hard. Ecod, I&#8217;ll teach you to be rough
with Craven, my cockerel Montagu!&#8221; And the
bully kicked me twice where I lay.</p>
<p>They dragged me to my feet, and Craven began to
sharpen his dull wit on me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two hundred guineas I get out of this, you cursed
rebel highwayman, besides the pleasure of seeing you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
wear hemp&mdash;and that&#8217;s worth a hundred more, sink
my soul to hell if it isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your soul is sunk there long ago, and this blackguard
job sends you one circle lower in the Inferno,
Catchpoll Craven,&#8221; said a sneering voice behind him.</p>
<p>Craven swung on his heel in a fury, but Volney&#8217;s
easy manner&mdash;and perhaps the reputation of his small
sword too&mdash;damped the mettle of his courage. He
drew back with a curse, whispered a word into the ear
of the nearest bailiff, and shouldered his way into the
crowd, from the midst of which he watched us with a
sneer.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what mad folly, may I ask, brought you back
to London a-courting the gallows?&#8221; inquired Volney
of me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you heard that Malcolm Macleod is
taken?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;And did you come to exchange places with him?
On my soul you&#8217;re madder than I thought. Couldn&#8217;t
you trust me to see that my future brother-in-law
comes to no harm without ramming your own head
down the lion&#8217;s throat? Faith, I think Craven has the
right of it: the hempen noose is yawning for such
fools as you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bailiffs took me to the New Prison and thrust
me into an underground cell about the walls of which
moisture hung in beads. Like the rest of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
prisoners I was heavily ironed by day and fastened
down to the floor by a staple at night. One hour in
the day we were suffered to go into the yard for
exercise and to be inspected and commented upon by
the great number of visitors who were allowed access
to the prison. On the second day of my arrival I
stood blinking in the strong sunlight, having just come
up from my dark cell, when two prisoners shuffled
across the open to me, their fetters dragging on the
ground. Conceive my great joy at finding Creagh
and Donald Roy fellow inmates of New Prison with
me. Indeed Captain Roy occupied the very next cell
to mine.</p>
<p>I shall not weary you with any account of our
captivity except to state that the long confinement in
my foul cell sapped my health. I fell victim to agues
and fevers. Day by day I grew worse until I began
to think that &#8217;twas a race between disease and the
gallows. Came at last my trial, and prison attendants
haled me away to the courts. Poor Leath,
white to the lips, was being hustled out of the room
just as I entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Heaven, Montagu, these whigs treat us like
dogs,&#8221; he cried passionately to me. &#8220;They are not
content with our lives, but must heap foul names and
infamy upon us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The guards hurried us apart before I could answer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
I asked one of them what the verdict had been in
Leath&#8217;s case, and the fellow with an evil laugh made a
horrid gesture with his hands that confirmed my worst
fears.</p>
<p>In the court room I found a frowning judge, a smug-faced
yawning jury, and row upon row of eager curious
spectators come to see the show. Besides these
there were some half-score of my friends attending in
the vain hope of lending me countenance. My shifting
glance fell on Charles, Cloe, and Aileen, all three
with faces like the corpse for colour and despairing eyes
which spoke of a hopeless misery. They had fought
desperately for my life, but they knew I was doomed.
I smiled sadly on them, then turned to shake hands
with George Selwyn.</p>
<p>He hoped, in his gentle drawl, that I would win
clear. My face lit up at his kindly interest. I was
like a drowning man clutching at straws. Even the
good-will of a turnkey was of value to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, Selwyn,&#8221; I said, a little brokenly. &#8220;I&#8217;m
afraid there&#8217;s no chance for me, but it&#8217;s good hearing
that you are on my side.&#8221;</p>
<p>He appeared embarrassed at my eagerness. Not
quite good form he thought it, I dare say. His next
words damped the glow at my heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Gad, yes! Of course. I ought to be; bet five
ponies with Craven that you would cheat the gallows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
yet. He gave me odds of three to one, and I thought
it a pretty good risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>It occurred to me fantastically that he was looking
me over with the eye of an underwriter who has insured
at a heavy premium a rotten hulk bound for
stormy seas. I laughed bitterly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may win yet,&#8221; I said. &#8220;This cursed prison
fever is eating me up;&#8221; and with that I turned my
back on him.</p>
<p>I do not intend to go into my trial with any particularity.
From first to last I had no chance and
everybody in the room understood it. There were a
dozen witnesses to prove that I had been in the thick
of the rebellion. Among the rest was Volney, in a
vile temper at being called on to give testimony. He
was one of your reluctant witnesses, showed a decided
acrimony toward the prosecution, and had to have
the facts drawn out of him as with a forceps. Such a
witness, of high social standing and evidently anxious
to shield me, was worth to the State more than all the
other paltry witnesses combined. The jury voted
guilty without leaving the court-room, after which the
judge donned his black cap and pronounced the horrible
judgment which was the doom of traitors. I was
gash with fear, but I looked him in the face and took
it smilingly. It was Volney who led the murmur of
approval which greeted my audacity, a murmur which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
broke frankly into applause when Aileen, white to the
lips, came fearlessly up to bid me be of good cheer,
that she would save me yet if the importunity of a
woman would avail aught.</p>
<p>Wearily the days dragged themselves into weeks,
and still no word of hope came to cheer me. There
was, however, one incident that gave me much pleasure.
On the afternoon before the day set for our execution
Donald Roy made his escape. Some one had given
him a file and he had been tinkering at his irons for
days. We were in the yard for our period of exercise,
and half a dozen of us, pretending to be in earnest
conversation together, surrounded him while he
snapped the irons. Some days before this time he
had asked permission to wear the English dress,
and he now coolly sauntered out of the prison
with some of the visitors quite unnoticed by the
guard.</p>
<p>The morning dawned on which nine of us were to
be executed. Our coffee was served to us in the room
off the yard, and we drank it in silence. I noticed
gladly that Macdonald was not with us, and from that
argued that he had not been recaptured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s wishing him a safe escape from the country,&#8221;
said Creagh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lucky dog!&#8221; murmured Leath, &#8220;I hope they
won&#8217;t nail him again.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></p>
<p>Brandy was served. Creagh named the toast and
we drank it standing.</p>
<p>&#8220;King James!&#8221;</p>
<p>The governor of the prison bustled in just as the
broken glasses shivered behind us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now gentlemen, if you are quite ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>Three sledges waited for us in the yard to draw us
to the gallows tree. There was no cowardly feeling,
but perhaps a little dilatoriness in getting into the first
sledge. Five minutes might bring a reprieve for any
of us, and to be in the first sledge might mean the
difference between life and death.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, gentlemen! If you please! Let us have
no more halting,&#8221; said the governor, irritably.</p>
<p>Creagh laughed hardily and vaulted into the sledge.
&#8220;Egad, you&#8217;re right! We&#8217;ll try a little haltering for
a change.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morgan followed him, and I took the third place.</p>
<p>A rider dismounted at the prison gate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there any news for me?&#8221; asked one poor fellow
eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the sheriff has just come and is waiting for
you,&#8221; jeered one of the guards with brutal frankness.</p>
<p>The poor fellow stiffened at once. &#8220;Very well. I
am ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>A heavy rain was falling, but the crowd between
the prison and Kennington Common was immense.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
At the time of our trials the mob had treated us in
ruffianly fashion, but now we found a respectful silence.
The lawyer Morgan was in an extremely irritable
mood. All the way to the Common he poured
into our inattentive ears a tale of woe about how his
coffee had been cold that morning. Over and over
again he recited to us the legal procedure for bringing
the matter into the courts with sufficient effect to have
the prison governor removed from his position.</p>
<p>A messenger with an official document was waiting
for us at the gallows. The sheriff tore it open. We
had all been bearing ourselves boldly enough I dare
say, but at sight of that paper our lips parched, our
throats choked, and our eyes burned. Some one was
to be pardoned or reprieved. But who? What a moment!
How the horror of it lives in one&#8217;s mind!
Leisurely the sheriff read the document through, then
deliberately went over it again while nine hearts stood
still. Creagh found the hardihood at that moment of
intense anxiety to complain of the rope about his
neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish the gossoon who made this halter was to
be hanged in it. &#8217;Slife, the thing doesn&#8217;t fit by a
mile,&#8221; he said jauntily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Anthony Creagh pardoned, Mr. Kenneth
Montagu reprieved,&#8221; said the sheriff without a trace
of feeling in his voice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></p>
<p>For an instant the world swam dizzily before me.
I closed my eyes, partly from faintness, partly to hide
from the other poor fellows the joy that leaped to
them. One by one the brave lads came up and shook
hands with Creagh and me in congratulation. Their
good-will took me by the throat, and I could only
wring their hands in silence.</p>
<p>On our way back to the prison Creagh turned to
me with streaming eyes. &#8220;Do you know whom I
have to thank for this, Kenneth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Whom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Antoinette Westerleigh, God bless her dear heart!&#8221;</p>
<p>And that set me wondering. It might be that
Charles and Aileen alone had won my reprieve for
me, but I suspected Volney&#8217;s fine hand in the matter.
Whether he had stirred himself in my affairs or not, I
knew that I too owed my life none the less to the leal
heart of a girl.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>VOLNEY&#8217;S GUEST</h3>
</div>

<p>Of all the London beaux not one had apartments
more elegant than Sir Robert Volney.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
It was one of the man&#8217;s vanities to play the
part of a fop, to disguise his restless force and eager
brain beneath the vapid punctilios of a man of fashion.
There were few suspected that his reckless gayety was
but a mask to hide a weary, unsatisfied heart, and that
this smiling debonair gentleman with the biting wit
was in truth the least happy of men. Long he had
played his chosen rôle. Often he doubted whether
the game were worth the candle, but he knew that he
would play it to the end, and since he had so elected
would bear himself so that all men should mark him.
If life were not what the boy Robert Volney had conceived
it; if failure were inevitable and even the fruit
of achievement bitter; if his nature and its enveloping
circumstance had proven more strong than his dim,
fast-fading, boyish ideals, at least he could cross the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
stage gracefully and bow himself off with a jest. So
much he owed himself and so much he would pay.</p>
<p>Something of all this perhaps was in Sir Robert
Volney&#8217;s mind as he lay on the couch with dreamy
eyes cast back into the yesterdays of life, that dim
past which echoed faintly back to him memories of a
brave vanished youth. On his lips, no doubt, played
the half ironic, half wistful smile which had become
habitual to the man.</p>
<p>And while with half-shut eyes his mind drifted
lazily back to that golden age forever gone, enter
from the inner room, Captain Donald Roy Macdonald,
a cocked pistol in his hand, on his head Volney&#8217;s hat
and wig, on his back Volney&#8217;s coat, on his feet Volney&#8217;s
boots. The baronet eyed the Highlander with
mild astonishment, then rose to his feet and offered
him a chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Delighted, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; he said politely.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look it,&#8221; drolled Macdonald.</p>
<p>&#8220;Off to the wars again, or are you still at your old
profession of lifting, my Highland cateran?&#8221;</p>
<p>Donald shrugged. &#8220;I am a man of many trades.
In my day I have been soldier, sailor, reiver, hunter
and hunted, doctor and patient, forby a wheen mair.
What the gods provide I take.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm! So I see. Prithee, make yourself at home,&#8221;
was Volney&#8217;s ironical advice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></p>
<p>Macdonald fell into an attitude before the glass and
admired himself vastly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fegs, I will that. The small-clothes now&mdash; Are
they not an admirable fit whatever? And the
coat&mdash; &#8217;Tis my measure to a nicety. Let me
congratulate you on your tailor. Need I say that the
periwig is a triumph of the friseur&#8217;s art?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your approval flatters me immensely,&#8221; murmured
Volney, smiling whimsically. &#8220;Faith, I never
liked my clothes so well as now. You make an admirable
setting for them, Captain, but the ruffles are
somewhat in disarray. If you will permit me to ring
for my valet Watkins he will be at your service.
Devil take him, he should have been here an hour
ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He sends by me a thousand excuses for his absence.
The fact is that he is unavoidably detained.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me. I begin to understand. You doubtless
found it necessary to put a quietus on him. May
one be permitted to hope that you didn&#8217;t have to
pistol him? I should miss him vastly. He is the
best valet in London.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your unselfish attachment to him does you infinite
credit, Sir Robert. It fair brings the water to my
een. But it joys me to reassure you at all events.
He is in your bedroom tied hand and foot, biting on
a knotted kerchief. I persuaded him to take a rest.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></p>
<p>Volney laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your powers of persuasion are great, Captain
Macdonald. Once you persuaded me to leave your
northern capital. The air, I think you phrased it,
was too biting for me. London too has a climate of
its own, a throat disease epidemic among northerners
is working great havoc here now. One trusts you
will not fall a victim, sir. Have you&mdash;er&mdash;developed
any symptoms?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twould nae doubt grieve you sair. You&#8217;ll be
gey glad to learn that the crisis is past.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Charmed, &#8217;pon honour. And would it be indiscreet
to ask whether you are making a long stay in
the city?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Faith, I wish I knew. Donald Roy wad be blithe
to answer no. And that minds me that I will be
owing you an apology for intruding in your rooms.
Let the facts speak for me. Stravaiging through the
streets with the chase hot on my heels, your open
window invited me. I stepped in, footed it up-stairs,
and found refuge in your sleeping apartments, where
I took the liberty of borrowing a change of clothes,
mine being over well known at the New Prison. So
too I purloined this good sword and the pistol. That
Sir Robert Volney was my host I did not know till I
chanced on some letters addressed to that name.
Believe me, I&#8217;m unco sorry to force myself upon you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I felicitate myself on having you as a guest. The
vapours had me by the throat to-night. Your presence
is a sufficing tonic for a most oppressive attack
of the blue devils. This armchair has been recommended
as an easy one. Pray occupy it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Roy tossed the pistol on a table and sat
him down in the chair with much composure.
Volney poured him wine and he drank; offered him
fruit and he ate. Together, gazing into the glowing
coals, they supped their mulled claret in a luxurious
silence.</p>
<p>The Highlander was the first to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a geyan queer warld this. <i>Anjour d&#8217;hui roi,
demain rien.</i> Yestreen I gaped away the hours in a
vile hole waiting for my craig (neck) to be raxed
(twisted); the night I drink old claret in the best of
company before a cheery fire. The warm glow of it
goes to my heart after that dank cell in the prison.
By heaven, the memory of that dungeon sends a shiver
down my spine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow, was it not, that you were to journey
to Tyburn and from thence across the Styx?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, to-morrow, and with me as pretty a lot of
lads as ever threw steel across their hurdies. My heart
is wae for them, the leal comrades who have lain out
with me in the heather many a night and watched the
stars come out. There&#8217;s Montagu and Creagh now!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
We three have tholed together empty wame and
niddering cold and the weariness o&#8217; death. The
hurly o&#8217; the whistling claymore has warmed our
hearts; the sight of friends stark from lead and steel
and rope has garred them rin like water. God, it
makes me feel like a deserter to let them take the
lang journey alane. Did you ken that the lad came
back to get me from the field when I was wounded at
Drummossie Moor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Montagu? I never heard that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Took his life in his hand to come back to that
de&#8217;il&#8217;s caldron where the red bluid ran like a mountain
burn. It iss the boast of the Macdonalds that they
always pay their debts both to friend and foe. Fine
have I paid mine. He will be thinking me the true
friend in his hour of need,&#8221; finished Donald bitterly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know him. The temper of the man is
not so grudging. His joy in your escape will help
deaden his own pain. Besides, what could you do for
him if you were with him at the end? &#8217;Twould be
only one more sacrifice.&#8221;</p>
<p>The grim dour Highland sternness hung heavy on
Donald&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could stand shoulder to shoulder with him and
curse the whigs at all events. I could cry with him
&#8216;God save King James&#8217; in the teeth of the sidier
roy.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></p>
<p>Volney clapped his hands softly. &#8220;Hear, hear!&#8221;
he cried with flaming eyes. &#8220;Almost thou persuadest
me to be a Jacobite.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Gael turned to him impetuously, his blue eyes
(as I conceive) moist with emotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Man, could I persuade you to be saving the lad?
It was for this that I waited in your rooms to see you.
They say that you are a favourite of princes, that what
you ask you get. Do for once a fine thing and ask
this boy&#8217;s life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They exaggerate my power. But for argument&#8217;s
sake suppose it true. Why should I ask it? What
have I to gain by it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Volney, his eyes fixed on the fire, asked the
question as much to himself as to the Highlander.
The manner of his tone suggested that it was not a
new one to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gain! Who spoke of gain? Are you a Jew
peddler or an English gentleman?&#8221; cried Donald.</p>
<p>&#8220;They call me dissolute, gambler, profligate. These
be hard names, but I have earned them all. I make
no apologies and offer no excuses. As I have lived
my life, so have I lived it. For buttered phrases I
have no taste. Call me libertine, or call me man of
fashion; &#8217;tis all one. My evil nature&mdash;<i>C&#8217;est plus fort
que moi</i>. At least I have not played the hypocrite.
No canting sighs! No lapses to morality and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
prayers! No vices smugly hidden! The plain
straight road to hell taken at a gallop!&#8221; So, with
chin in hand and dark eyes lit by the flickering flame,
this roué and sentimentalist philosophized.</p>
<p>&#8220;And Montagu?&#8221; cried the Gael, harking back to
his prosaic text.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has made his bed and he must lie in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By Heaven, who ruined him and made an outlaw
of him? Who drove him to rebellion?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You imply that I strewed his bed with nettles.
Perhaps. &#8217;Tis well my shoulders are broad, else they
could not bear all that is laid upon them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You would never be letting a petty private grudge
influence you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Volney turned, stung to the quick.</p>
<p>&#8220;You go too far, Captain Macdonald. Have I
given bonds to save this fool from the consequences
of his folly? I cherish no hatred toward him, but I
play no Jonathan to his David. Egad, it were a
pretty rôle for me to essay! You would cast me for
a part full of heroics, the moving of heaven and earth
to save my dearest enemy. Thank you, I am not for
it. Neither for nor against him will I lift a hand.
There is no malice in my heart toward this poor condemned
young gentleman. If he can win free I shall
be glad, even though his gain is my loss, but further
than that I will not go. He came between me and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
the thing I most desired on earth. Shall I help him
to the happiness which will condemn me to misery?&#8221;</p>
<p>For an instant the habitual veil of mockery was
snatched aside and the tortured soul of the man
leaped from his burning eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You saved him at Portree,&#8221; was all that Donald
could say.</p>
<p>&#8220;I paid a debt to him and to Cumberland. The
ledger is now balanced.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Jacobite paced up and down the room for a
minute, then stopped and touched the other on his
shoulder where he sat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I too am somewhat in your debt, Sir Robert.
When Montagu opposed you he fought for his own
hand. Therein he was justified. But I, an outsider,
interfered in a quarrel that was not mine own, spoiled
sport for you, in short lost you the lassie. You followed
her to Scotland; &#8217;twas I that drove you back
to England when Montagu was powerless. From
first to last I am the rock on which your love bark
has split. If your cause has spelled failure I alone
am to blame.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So? What then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why this: without Captain Donald Roy Macdonald
the lad had been helpless. Donald was at his
back to whisper words of advice and encouragement.
Donald contrived the plot which separated you from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
the lady. Donald stood good fairy to the blessed pair
of bairns and made of himsel&#8217; a match-making auld
mither. You owe your hatred to Donald Roy and
not to the lad who was but his instrument.&#8221;</p>
<p>The macaroni looked at the other with an odd smile
twitching at the corners of his mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And so,&#8221; continued the Macdonald triumphantly,
a challenge in his voice and manner, &#8220;and so, who but
Donald should be your enemy? My certes, a prettier
foe at the broadsword you will not find in a&#8217; Scotland.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not quite take your meaning. Would you
fight with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blithe would I be to cross the steel with you, but
little that would help Kenneth. My plan is this:
save the lad from the halter and I will tak&#8217; his place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean that if I compass his freedom you will
surrender to be executed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am meaning just that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so from the first. &#8217;Slife, man, do you
think I can change my foes like gloves? <i>Chacun
paie son écot.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not? Iss not a man a better foe than a
halfling boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would never seek a better foe or a better friend
than either you or Montagu, Captain. On my soul,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
you have both the true ring. But as to your offer I
must decline it. The thing is one of your wild impracticable
Highland imaginings, a sheer impossibility.
You seem to think I have a blood feud and that
nothing less than a foeman&#8217;s life will satisfy me. In
that you err. I am a plain man of the world and cannot
reach your heroics.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Jacobite&#8217;s face fell.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are going to let the boy die then?&#8221;</p>
<p>Volney hesitated, then answered with a shrug.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be frank with you. To-day I secured
Montagu a reprieve for two weeks. He shall have
his chance such as it is, but I do not expect him to
take it. If he shows stubborn I wash my hands of
him. I have said the last word. You may talk till
Yule without changing my mind.&#8221; Then, with an
abrupt turn of the subject: &#8220;Have you with you the
sinews of war, Captain? You will need money to
effect your escape. My purse is at your service not
less than my wardrobe, or if you care to lie hidden
here for a time you will be quite safe. Watkins is a
faithful fellow and devoted to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Highlander flushed, stammering out:</p>
<p>&#8220;For your proffered loan, I accept it with the best
will in the world; and as to your offer of a hiding-place,
troth! I&#8217;m badly needing one. Gin it were
no inconvenience&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></p>
<p>&#8220;None in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will be remembering you for a generous foe till
the day of my death. You&#8217;re a man to ride the water
wi&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lard! There&#8217;s no generosity in it. Every
Mohawk thinks it a pleasure to help any man break
the laws. Besides, I count on you to help drive away
the doldrums. Do you care for a hand at piquet now,
Captain?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With pleasure. I find in the cartes great diversion,
but by your leave I&#8217;ll first unloose your man
Watkins.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Slife, I had forgot him. We&#8217;ll have him brew us
a punch and make a night of it. Sleep and I are a
thousand miles apart.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW</h3>
</div>

<p>There came to me one day a surprise, a
marked hour among my weeks struck calm.
Charles, Cloe, and Aileen had been wont to
visit me regularly; once Selwyn had dropped in on
me; but I had not before been honoured by a visit
from Sir Robert Volney. He sauntered into my cell
swinging a clouded cane, dressed to kill and point device
in every ruffle, all dabbed with scented powder,
pomatum, and jessamine water. To him, coming
direct from the strong light of the sun, my cell was
dark as the inside of Jonah&#8217;s whale. He stood hesitating
in the doorway, groping with his cane for some
guide to his footsteps.</p>
<p>For an instant I drew back, thinking he had come
to mock me; then I put the idea from me. However
much of evil there was in him, Volney was not a small
man. I stepped forward to greet him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome to my poor best, Sir Robert! If I do
not offer you a chair it is because I have none. My
regret is that my circumstances hamper my hospitality.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all. You offer me your best, and in that
lies the essence of hospitality. Better a dinner of
herbs where love is than a stalled ox and hatred,
Egad,&#8221; returned my guest with easy irony.</p>
<p>All the resources of the courtier and the beau were
his. One could but admire the sparkle and the versatility
of the man. His wit was brilliant as the play
of a rapier&#8217;s point. Set down in cold blood, remembered
scantily and clumsily as I recall it, without the
gay easy polish of his manner, the fineness is all out
of his talk. After all &#8217;tis a characteristic of much wit
that it is apposite to the occasion only and loses point
in the retelling.</p>
<p>He seated himself on the table with a leg dangling
in air and looked curiously around on the massive
masonry, the damp floor, the walls oozing slime. I
followed his eye and in some measure his thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stone walls do not a prison make,&#8221; I quoted gaily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ecod, they make a pretty fair imitation of one!&#8221;
he chuckled.</p>
<p>I was prodigious glad to see him.</p>
<p>His presence stirred my sluggish blood. The sound
of his voice was to me like the crack of a whip to a
jaded horse. Graceful, careless, debonair, a man of
evil from sheer reckless wilfulness, he was the one
person in the world I found it in my heart to both
hate and admire at the same time.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></p>
<p>He gazed long at me. &#8220;You&#8217;re looking devilish ill,
Montagu,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>I smiled. &#8220;Are you afraid I&#8217;ll cheat the hangman
after all?&#8221;</p>
<p>His eyes wandered over the cell again. &#8220;By
Heaven, this death&#8217;s cage is enough to send any man
off the hooks,&#8221; he shivered.</p>
<p>&#8220;One gets used to it,&#8221; I answered, shrugging.</p>
<p>He looked at me with a kind of admiration. &#8220;They
may break you, Montagu, but I vow they will never
bend you. Here are you torn with illness, the shadow
of the gallows falling across your track, and never a
whimper out of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would that avail to better my condition?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose not. Still, self-pity is the very ecstasy
of grief, they tell me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For girls and halfling boys, I dare say.&#8221;</p>
<p>There he sat cocked on the table, a picture of smiling
ease, raffish and fascinating, as full of sentimental
sympathy as a lass in her teens. His commiseration
was no less plain to me because it was hidden under a
debonair manner. He looked at me in a sidelong
fashion with a question in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Speak out!&#8221; I told him. &#8220;Your interest in me
as evidenced by this visit has earned the right to
satisfy your curiosity.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I dare swear you have had your chance to save
yourself?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the usual offer! A life for a life, the opportunity
to save myself by betraying others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you never dally with the thought of it?&#8221; he
questioned.</p>
<p>I looked up quickly at him. A hundred times I
had nursed the temptation and put it from me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you never afraid, Montagu, when the night
falls black and slumber is not to be wooed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Many a time,&#8221; I told him, smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;You say it as easily as if I had asked whether you
ever took the air in the park. &#8217;Slife, I have never
known you flinch. There was always a certain d&mdash;&mdash;d
rough plainness about you, but you play the game.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a poor hound falls whining at the whip when
there is no avoiding it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will never accept their offer of a pardon on
those terms. I know you, man. Y&#8217;are one of those
fools hold by honour rather than life, and damme! I
like you for it. Now I in your place&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash;Would do as I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would I? I&#8217;m not so sure. If I did it would be
no virtue, but an obstinacy not to be browbeat.&#8221;
Then he added, &#8220;You would give anything else on
earth for your life, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything else,&#8221; I told him frankly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Anything else?&#8221; he repeated, his eyes narrowing.
&#8220;No reservations, Montagu?&#8221;</p>
<p>Our eyes crossed like rapiers, each searching into
the other&#8217;s very soul.</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I to understand that you are making me an
offer, Sir Robert?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am making you an offer of your life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Respectfully declined.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Think again, man! Once you are dead you will
be a long time dead. Refuse to give her up, and you
die; she is not for you in any case. Give way, and I
will move heaven and earth for a pardon. Believe me,
never was such perfect weather before. The birds
sing divinely, and Charles tells me Montagu Grange is
sorely needing a master.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Charles will look the part to admiration.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And doubtless will console himself in true
brotherly fashion for the loss of his brother by reciting
his merits on a granite shaft and straightway forgetting
them in the enjoyment of the estate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it likely.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at me gloomily. &#8220;There is a way to
save you, despite your obstinacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>I shuffled across to him in a tumult of emotion.
&#8220;You would never do it, would never be so vile as to
trade on her fears for me to win her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would do anything to win her, and I would do a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
great deal to save your life. The two things jump together.
In a way I like you, man.&#8221;</p>
<p>But I would have none of his liking. &#8220;Oh, spare
me that! You are the most sentimental villain unhung,
and I can get along without your liking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s as may be,&#8221; said he laughing, &#8220;but I cannot
well get along without you. On my honour, you
have become one of my greatest sources of interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean that you would stake my life
against her hand?&#8221; I demanded whitely.</p>
<p>He gave me look for look. &#8220;I mean just that. By
Heaven, I shall win her fair or foul.&#8221;</p>
<p>I could only keep saying over and over again, &#8220;You
would never do it. Even you would never do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t I? You&#8217;ll see,&#8221; he answered laughing
hardily. &#8220;Well, I must be going. Oh, I had forgot.
Balmerino sent you this note. I called on him yesterday
at the Tower. The old Scotchman is still as full
of smiles as a bride.&#8221;</p>
<p>Balmerino&#8217;s letter was the friendliest imaginable.
He stated that for him a pardon was of course out of
the question, but that Sir Robert Volney had assured
him that there was a chance for me on certain conditions;
he understood that the conditions had to do
with the hand of a young woman, and he advised me,
if the thing were consistent with honour, to make submission,
and let no foolish pride stand in the way of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
saving my life. The letter ended with a touching reference
to the cause for which he was about to die.</p>
<p>I was shaken, I confess it. Not that I thought for
a moment of giving up my love, but my heart ached
to think of the cruel position into which she would be
cast. To save her lover&#8217;s life, she must forsake her
love, or if she elected the other alternative must send
him to his death. That Volney would let this burden
of choice fall on her I would scarce let myself believe;
and yet&mdash;there was never a man more madly,
hopelessly in love than he. His passion for her
was like a whirlwind tossing him hither and thither
like a chip on the boiling waters, but I thought it very
characteristic of the man that he used his influence to
have me moved to a more comfortable cell and supplied
with delicacies, even while he plotted against me
with my love.</p>
<p>After that first visit he used to come often and entertain
me with the news and gossip of the town. I
have never met a more interesting man. He was an
onlooker of life rather than an actor, an ironical cynic,
chuckling with sardonic humour. The secret of his
charm lay perhaps in a certain whimsical outlook and
in an original turn of mind.</p>
<p>Once I asked him why he found it worth while to
spend so many hours with me when his society was so
much sought after by the gayest circle in the town.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I acquit you of any suspicion of philanthropy, Sir
Robert. I give you credit for pursuing a policy of
intelligent selfishness. You must know by this time
that I will not purchase my life, nor let it be purchased,
on the terms which you propose. Well then,
I confess it puzzles me to guess what amusement you
find in such a hole as this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Variety spices life. What&#8217;s a man to do to keep
himself from ennui? For instance, I got up this morning
at ten, with Selwyn visited Lady Dapperwit while
she was drinking coffee in her nightrail, talked a vast
deal of scandal with her, strolled in the park with
Fritz, from there to White&#8217;s in a sedan, two hours at
lunch, and an hour with you for the good of my
soul.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The good of your soul?&#8221; I quizzed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I visit you here and then go away deuced
thankful for my mercies. I&#8217;m not to be hanged next
week, you know. I live to marry the girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, I should think you might find more interesting
spots than this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a student of human nature, Montagu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A condemned prisoner, never a wit at the best of
times, full of fears and agues and fevers! One would
scarce think the subject an inviting one for study.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There you do yourself injustice. Y&#8217;are the most
interesting man I know. A dozen characters are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
wrapped up in you. You have the appearance of being
as great a rip as the rest of us, and I vow your
looks do not belie you, yet at times you have the conscience
of a ranting dissenter. I find in you a touch
both of Selwyn&#8217;s dry wit and of Balmerino&#8217;s frostly
bluntness; the cool daring of James Wolfe combined
with as great a love of life as Murray has shown; the
chivalry of Don Quixote and the hard-headedness of
Cumberland; sometimes an awkward boy, again the
grand manner Chesterfield himself might envy you;
the obstinacy of the devil and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, come!&#8221; I broke in laughing. &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind
being made a composite epitome of all the vices of
the race, but I object to your crossing the Styx on my
behalf.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that reminds me of the time we came so
near crossing together,&#8221; he broke out, diverting the
subject in his inconsequent fashion. &#8220;D&#8217;ye remember
that Dr. Mead who dressed our wounds for us after
our little argument? It appears that he and a Dr.
Woodward fell into some professional dispute as to
how a case should be treated, and Lud! nothing
would satisfy them but they must get their toasting
forks into action. The story goes that they fought at
the gate of Gresham College. Mead pinked his man.
&#8216;Take your life,&#8217; quoth he. &#8216;Anything but your
medicine,&#8217; returns Woodward just before he faints.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
Horry Walpole told me the story. I suppose you
have heard Selwyn&#8217;s story of Lord Wharton. You
know what a spendthrift Wharton is. Well the Duke
of Graftsbury offered him one of his daughters in
marriage, a lady of uncertain age and certain temper.
But the lady has one virtue; she&#8217;s a devilish fine
fortune. A plum, they say! Wharton wrote Graftsbury
a note of three lines declining the alliance because,
as he put it, the fortune was tied up and the
lady wasn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not bad. Talking of Selwyn, I suppose he gets
his fill of horrors these days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One would think he might. I met him at the
Prince&#8217;s dinner yesterday, and between us we two
emptied nine bottles of maraschino. Conceive the
splitting headache I&#8217;m wearing to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You should take a course in Jacobitism,&#8221; I told
him gravely. &#8220;&#8217;Tis warranted to cure gout, liver
trouble, indigestion, drunkenness, and sundry other
complaints. I can warrant that one lives simply while
he takes the treatment; sometimes on a crust of
bread and a bowl of brose, sometimes on water from
the burn, never does one dine over-richly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet this course is not conducive to long life.
I&#8217;ve known a hundred followers of it fall victim to an
epidemic throat disease,&#8221; he retorted. Then he added
more gravely, &#8220;By the way, you need have no fears
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
for your friend Miss Flora Macdonald. I learn on the
best of authority that she is in no danger whatever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Malcolm?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;His name has been put near the foot of the list
for trial. Long before that time the lust for blood
will be glutted. I shall make it a point to see that his
case never comes to trial. One cannot afford to have
his brother-in-law hanged like a common cutpurse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Day by day the time drew nearer on which my reprieve
expired. I saw nothing of Aileen now, for she
had followed the King and his court to Bath, intent on
losing no opportunity that might present itself in my
favour. For one reason I was glad to have her gone;
so long as she was out of town Sir Robert could not
urge on her the sacrifice which he intended.</p>
<p>The time of my execution had been set for Friday,
and on the preceding Monday Volney, just arrived
from the executions of Balmerino and Kilmarnock,
drove out to New Prison to see me. He was full of
admiration for Balmerino&#8217;s bold exit from the stage
of life and retailed to me with great gusto every
incident of the last scene on Tower Hill.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like your bluff Balmerino&#8217;s philosophy of life,&#8221; he
told me. &#8220;When I called on him and apologized for
intruding on the short time he had left the old Lord
said, &#8216;O sir, no intrusion at all. I am in no ways
concerned to spend more time than usual at my devotions.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
I think no man fit to live who is not fit to die,
and to die well is much the easier of the two.&#8217; On the
scaffold no bridegroom could have been more cheerful.
He was dressed in his old blue campaign uniform and
was as bold and manly as ever. He expressed joy that
Cromartie had been pardoned, inspected with interest
the inscription on his coffin, and smilingly called the
block his pillow of rest. &#8217;Pon honour, the intrepid
man then rehearsed the execution with his headsman,
kneeling down at the block to show how he would
give the signal for the blow. He then got up again,
made a tender smiling farewell with his friends, and
said to me, &#8216;I fear some will think my behaviour bold,
Volney, but remember what I say, that it arises from
confidence in God and a clear conscience.&#8217; He reaffirmed
his unshaken adherence to the house of
Stuart, crying aloud, &#8216;God save King James!&#8217; and
bowed to the multitude. Presently, still cheerfully, he
knelt at the block and said in a clear voice, &#8216;O Lord,
reward my friends, forgive my enemies, bless Prince
Charles and his brother, the Duke, and receive my
soul.&#8217; His arms dropped for the signal, and Arthur
Elphinstone of Balmerino passed to the Valhalla where
brave men dwell as gods.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God bring peace to his valiant restless soul,&#8221; I said,
much moved.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a thing to admire, the sturdy loyalty of you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
Jacobites,&#8221; he said after a pause. &#8220;You carry it off
like gentlemen. Every poor Highlander who has yet
suffered has flung out his &#8216;God save King James&#8217; on
the scaffold. Now I&#8217;ll wager you too go to death
with the grand air&mdash;no canting prayers for King
George, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must e&#8217;en do as the rest,&#8221; I smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet I&#8217;d bet a pony you don&#8217;t care a pinch of
snuff for James Stuart. &#8217;Tis loyalty to yourselves
that animates you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently he harked back to the topic that was
never closed between us.</p>
<p>&#8220;By this time next week you will have touched the
heart of our eternal problem. The mystery of it will
perhaps be all clear to you then. &#8217;Tis most strange
how at one sweep all a man&#8217;s turbulent questing life
passes into the quiet of&mdash;of what? That is the
question: of unending death or of achieved knowledge?&#8221;
Then he added, coming abruptly to the
issue: &#8220;The day draws near. Do you think better
of my offer now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir Robert, I have lived a tempestuous life these
past months. I have known hunger and cold and
weariness; I have been at the top of fortune&#8217;s wave
and at the bottom; but I have never found it worth my
while to become divorced from honour. You find me
near dead from privations and disease. Do you think
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
I would pay so much for such an existence? Believe
me, when a man has passed through what I have he
is empty of fears.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could better spare a better man,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry to inconvenience you,&#8221; I told him grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217; faith, I think you&#8217;re destined to do that dead or
alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I am. You will find me more in your
way dead than alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll outlive your memory, never fear.&#8221; Then
quietly, after a moment&#8217;s hesitation: &#8220;There&#8217;s one
thing it may be a comfort for you to know. I&#8217;ve given
up any thought of putting her on the rack. I&#8217;ll win
fairly or not at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>I drew a deep free breath. &#8220;Thank you for telling
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean to marry her though. I swear to you,
Montagu, that my heart is wrapped up in her. I
thought all women alike until I met this one. Now I
know better. She could have made a different man
of me; sometimes I think she could even yet. I vow
to you I would not now injure a hair of her head,
but willy-nilly, in the end I shall marry the girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To ruin her life?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To save mine rather.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think yourself able to change the whole
course of your life for her?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span></p>
<p>He mused. &#8220;Ah, Montagu! There your finger
falls pat on the pulse of my doubt. My heart cries
aye, my reason gives a negative.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry overmuch about it,&#8221; I answered, railing
at him. &#8220;She&#8217;ll never look at you, man. My
grave will be an insurmountable barrier. She will
idealize my memory, think me a martyr and herself a
widowed maid.&#8221;</p>
<p>The shot scored. &#8217;Twas plain he must have often
thought of that himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may interest you to know that we are engaged
to be married,&#8221; I added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed! Let me congratulate you. When does
the happy event occur, may I ask? Or is the day
set?&#8221;</p>
<p>He had no need to put into words more clearly the
irony of the fate that encompassed us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead or alive, as you say, I bar your way,&#8221; I said
tartly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh, man! I give you six weeks of violent grief,
six months of tender melancholy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not know the Scotch. She will die a
maid,&#8221; I answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not she! A live lover is more present than a
dead one. Has she sworn pretty vows to you, Montagu?
&#8216;At lovers&#8217; perjuries, they say, love laughs.&#8217;
Is there nothing to be said for me? Will her heart
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
not always whisper that I deserve gratitude and love,
that I perilled my life for her, saved the lives of her
brother and her lover, neither of them friends of mine,
again reprieved her lover&#8217;s life, stood friend to her
through all her trouble? You know a woman&#8217;s way&mdash;to
make much of nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgive, if I prod a lagging memory, Miss Westerleigh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Long he laughed and merrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eloped for Gretna Green with Tony Creagh last
night, and I, poor forsaken swain, faith! I do not
pursue.&#8221;</p>
<p>You may be sure that dashed me. I felt as a
trapped fox with the dogs closing in. The future
loomed up clear before me, Aileen hand in hand with
Volney scattering flowers on my grave in sentimental
mood. The futility of my obstinacy made me
bitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Montagu! Listen to reason,&#8221; urged the
tempter. &#8220;You get in my way, but I don&#8217;t want to
let you be sponged out. The devil of it is that if I
get you a pardon&mdash;and I&#8217;m not sure that I can get it&mdash;you&#8217;ll
marry the girl. I might have you shipped
to the Barbadoes as a slave with some of the others,
but to be frank I had rather see you hanged than give
you so scurvy an end. Forswear what is already lost
and make an end of it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></p>
<p>I turned away blackly. &#8220;You have my answer.
Sir Robert, you have played your last card. Now let
me die in peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shrugged impatiently and left me. &#8220;A fool&#8217;s
answer, yet a brave man&#8217;s too,&#8221; he muttered.</p>
<p>Aileen, heart-broken with the failure of her mission,
reached town on Thursday and came at once to the
prison. Her face was as the face of troubled waters.
I had no need to ask the question on my lips. With
a sobbing cry she threw herself on my breast. My
heart was woe for her. Utter weariness was in her
manner. All through the long days and nights she
had agonized, and now at last despaired. There
seemed no tears left to shed.</p>
<p>Long I held her tight, teeth set, as one who would
keep his own perforce from that grim fate which
would snatch his love from him. She shivered to me
half-swooning, pale and of wondrous beauty, nesting
in my arms as a weary homing-bird. A poignant
grief o&#8217;erflowed in me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Aileen! At least we have love left,&#8221; I cried,
breaking the long silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Always! Always!&#8221; her white lips answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let us regret nothing. They can do with
me what they will. What are life and death when in
the balance dwells love?&#8221; I cried, rapt in unearthly
worship of her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></p>
<p>Her eyes found mine. &#8220;Oh, Kenneth, I cannot&mdash;I
cannot&mdash;let you go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sweet and lovely she was beyond the dream of
poet. I trembled in an ecstasy of pain. From the
next cell there came to us softly the voice of a poor
condemned Appin Stewart. He was crooning that
most tender and heart-breaking of all strains. Like
the pibroch&#8217;s mournful sough he wailed it out, the
song that cuts deep to a Scotchman&#8217;s heart in time of
exile.</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Lochabar no more, Lochabar no more.</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>I looked at Aileen, my face working. A long
breath came whistling through her lips. Her dear
face was all broken with emotion. I turned my eyes
aside, not daring to trust myself. Through misty
lashes again I looked. Her breast lifted and fell in
shaking sobs, the fount of tears touched at last. Together
we wept, without shame I admit it, while the
Stewart&#8217;s harrowing strain ebbed to a close. To us it
seemed almost as the keening of the coronach.</p>
<p>So in the quiet that comes after storm, her dear
supple figure still in my arms, Sir Robert Volney
came in unexpectedly and found us. He stopped at
the door, startled at her presence, and methought a
shadow fell on his face. Near to death as I was, the
quality of his courage was so fine and the strength of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
the passion in him so great that he would have
changed places with me even then.</p>
<p>Aileen went up to him at once and gave him her
hand. She was very simple, her appeal like a child&#8217;s
for directness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir Robert, you have already done much for me.
I will be so bold as to ask you to do more. Here iss
my lover&#8217;s life in danger. I ask you to save it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That he may marry you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If God wills.&#8221;</p>
<p>Volney looked at her out of a haggard face, all
broken by the emotions which stirred him.</p>
<p>A minute passed, two minutes. He fought out his
fight and won.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aileen,&#8221; he said at last, &#8220;before heaven I fear it is
too late, but what man can do, that will I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>He came in and shook hands with me. &#8220;I&#8217;ll say
good-bye, Montagu. &#8217;Tis possible I&#8217;ll see you but
once more in this world. Yet I will do my best.
Don&#8217;t hope too much, but don&#8217;t despair.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was unconscious prophecy in his words. I
was to see him but the once more, and then the
proud, gallant gentleman, now so full of energy, was
lying on his deathbed struck out of life by a foul
blow.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>THE SHADOW FALLS</h3>
</div>

<p>It would appear that Sir Robert went direct from
the prison to the club room at White&#8217;s. He was
observed to be gloomy, preoccupied, his manner
not a little perturbed. The usual light smile was completely
clouded under a gravity foreign to his nature.
One may guess that he was in no humour to carry
coals. In a distant corner of the room he seated himself
and fell to frowning at the table on which his
elbow rested. At no time was he a man upon whom
one would be likely to foist his company undesired,
for he had at command on occasion a hauteur and an
aloofness that challenged respect even from the most
inconsiderate.</p>
<p>We must suppose that he was moved out of his
usual indifference, that some long-dormant spring of
nobility was quickened to a renewed life, that a girl&#8217;s
truth and purity, refining his selfish passion, had bitten
deep into the man&#8217;s callous worldliness. For long he
sat in a sombre silence with his head leaning on his
hand, his keen mind busy with the problem&mdash;so I shall
always believe&mdash;as to how he might even yet save
me from the gallows.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></p>
<p>By some strange hap it chanced that Sir James
Craven, excited with drink, the bile of his saturnine
temper stirred to malignity by heavy losses at cards,
alighted from his four in hand at White&#8217;s shortly after
Volney. Craven&#8217;s affairs had gone from bad to worse
very rapidly of late. He had been playing the races
heavily and ruin stared the man in the face. More
than suspected of dubious play at cards, it had been
scarce a week since the stewards of a leading racetrack
had expelled him for running crosses. Any day a
debtor&#8217;s prison might close on him. Within the hour,
as was afterward learned, his former companion Frederick
Prince of Wales had given him the cut direct on
the Mall. Plainly his star was on the decline, and he
raged in a futile passion of hatred against the world.
Need it be said that of all men he most hated his supplanter
in the Prince of Wales&#8217; good-will, Sir Robert
Volney.</p>
<p>To Volney then, sitting gloomily in his distant solitude,
came Craven with murder in his heart and a
bitter jest on his lips. At the other side of the table
he found a seat and glared across at his rival out of a
passion-contorted face. Sir Robert looked past him
coldly, negligently, as if he had not been there, and
rising from his seat moved to the other side of the
room. In the manner of his doing it there was something
indescribably insulting; so it seemed to Topham
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
Beauclerc, who retailed to me the story
later.</p>
<p>Craven&#8217;s evil glance followed Volney, rage in his
bloodshot eyes. If a look could kill, the elegant macaroni
had been a dead man then. It is to be guessed
that Craven struggled with his temper and found himself
not strong enough to put a curb upon it; that his
heady stress of passion swept away his fear of Volney&#8217;s
sword. At all events there he sat glowering blackly
on the man at whose charge he chose to lay all his
misfortunes, what time he gulped down like water
glass after glass of brandy. Presently he got to his
feet and followed Sir Robert, still dallying no doubt
with the fascinating temptation of fixing a quarrel
upon his rival and killing him. To do him justice
Volney endeavoured to avoid an open rupture with the
man. He appeared buried in the paper he was reading.</p>
<p>&#8220;What news?&#8221; asked Craven abruptly.</p>
<p>For answer the other laid down the paper, so that
Sir James could pick it up if he chose.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see your old rival Montagu is to dance on air
to-morrow. &#8217;Gad, you&#8217;ll have it all your own way
with the wench then,&#8221; continued Craven boisterously,
the liquor fast mounting to his head.</p>
<p>Volney&#8217;s eyes grew steelly. He would have left,
but the burly purple-faced baronet cut off his retreat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Damme, will you drink with me, or will you play
with me, Volney?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, but I never drink nor play at this time of
day, Sir James. If it will not inconvenience you to
let me pass&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>With a foolish laugh, beside himself with rage and
drink, Craven flung him back into his chair.
&#8220;&#8217;Sdeath, don&#8217;t be in such a hurry! I want to talk to
you about&mdash; Devil take it, what is it I want to talk
about?&mdash; Oh, yes! That pink and white baggage of
yours. Stap me, the one look ravished me! Pity
you let a slip of a lad like Montagu oust you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That subject is one which we will not discuss, Sir
James,&#8221; said Volney quietly. &#8220;It is not to be mentioned
in my presence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The devil it isn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m not in the habit of asking
what I may talk about. As for this mistress of
yours&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir Robert rose and stood very straight. &#8220;I have
the honour to inform you that you are talking of a
lady who is as pure as the driven snow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck Craven stared. &#8220;After Sir Robert Volney
has pursued her a year?&#8221; he asked with venomous
spleen, his noisy laugh echoing through the room.</p>
<p>I can imagine how the fellow said it, with what a
devilish concentration of malice. He had the most
irritating manner of any man in England; I never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
heard him speak without wanting to dash my fist in
his sneering face.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what I tell you. I repeat that the subject
is not a matter for discussion between us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Craven might have read a warning in the studied
gentleness of Volney&#8217;s cold manner, but he was by
this time far beyond reck. By common consent the
eyes of every man in the room were turned on these
two, and Craven&#8217;s vanity sunned itself at holding once
more the centre of the stage.</p>
<p>&#8220;And after the trull has gadded about the country
with young Montagu in all manner of disguises?&#8221; he
continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;You lie, you hound!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir James sputtered in a speechless paroxysm of
passion, found words at last and poured them out in a
turbid torrent of invective. He let fall the word
baggage again, and presently, growing more plain, a
word that is not to be spoken of an honest woman.
Volney, eyeing him disdainfully, the man&#8217;s coarse
bulk, his purple cheeks and fishy eyes, played with
his wine goblet, white fingers twisting at the stem;
then, when the measure of the fellow&#8217;s offense was
full, put a period to his foul eloquence.</p>
<p>Full in the mouth the goblet struck him. Blood
spurted from his lips, and a shower of broken glass
shivered to the ground. Craven leaped across the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
table at his enemy in a blind fury; restrained by the
united efforts of half a dozen club members, the
struggling madman still foamed to get at his rival&#8217;s
throat&mdash;that rival whose disdainful eyes seemed to
count him but a mad dog impotent to bite.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would not drink with me; you would not play
with me; but, by God, you will have to fight with me,&#8221;
he cried at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Always I have hated you, wanted always to kill
you, now I shall do it,&#8221; he screamed.</p>
<p>Volney turned on his heel and beckoned to
Beauclerc.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you act for me, Topham?&#8221; he asked; and
when the other assented, added: &#8220;Arrange the affair
to come off as soon as possible. I want to have done
with the thing at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>They fought within the hour in the Field of the
Forty Footsteps. The one was like fire, the other ice.
They were both fine swordsmen, but there was no man
in England could stand against Volney at his best,
and those who were present have put it on record that
Sir Robert&#8217;s skill was this day at high water mark.
He fought quite without passion, watching with cool
alertness for his chance to kill. His opponent&#8217;s breath
came short, his thrusts grew wild, the mad rage of the
man began to give way to a no less mad despair.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
Every feint he found anticipated, every stroke parried;
and still his enemy held to the defensive with a deadly
cold watchfulness that struck chill to the heart of the
fearful bully. We are to conceive that Craven tasted
the bitterness of death, that in the cold passionless face
opposite to him he read his doom, and that in the
horrible agony of terror that sweated him he forgot
the traditions of his class and the training of a lifetime.
He stumbled, and when Sir Robert held his hand,
waiting point groundward with splendid carelessness
for his opponent to rise, Craven flung himself forward
on his knees and thrust low at him. The blade went
home through the lower vitals.</p>
<p>Volney stood looking at him a moment with a face
of infinite contempt, than sank back into the arms of
Beauclerc.</p>
<p>While the surgeon was examining the wound
Craven stole forward guiltily to the outskirts of the
little group which surrounded the wounded man. His
horror-stricken eyes peered out of a face like chalk.
The man&#8217;s own second had just turned his back on
him, and he was already realizing that the foul stroke
had written on his forehead the brand of Cain, had
made him an outcast and a pariah on the face of the
earth.</p>
<p>The eyes of Volney and his murderer met, those of
the dying man full of scorn. Craven&#8217;s glance fell before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
that steady look. He muttered a hope that the
wound was but slight; then, in torture, burst out:
&#8220;&#8217;Twas a slip. By Heaven, it was, Volney! I would
to God it were undone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;To every coward safety, and afterward his evil
hour,&#8217;&#8221; quoted Volney with cold disdain.</p>
<p>The murderer turned away with a sobbing oath,
mounted his horse and rode for the coast to begin his
lifetime of exile, penury, and execration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I get my passport?&#8221; asked Sir Robert of the
surgeon.</p>
<p>The latter began to talk a jargon of medical terms,
but Volney cut him short.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough! I understand,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;Get
me to my rooms and send at once for the Prince of
Wales. Beauclerc, may I trouble you to call on
Cumberland and get from him an order to bring
young Montagu to my place from the prison? And
will you send my man Watkins for a lawyer? Oh,
and one more commission&mdash;a messenger to beg of
Miss Macleod her attendance. In case she demurs,
make it plain to her that I am a dying man. Faith,
Topham, you&#8217;ll be glad I do not die often. I fear I
am an unconscionable nuisance at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Topham Beauclerc drove straight to the residence of
the Duke of Cumberland. He found the Duke at
home, explained the situation in a few words, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
presently the pair of them called on the Duke of Newcastle
and secured his counter-signature for taking me
temporarily from the New Prison. Dusk was falling
when Beauclerc and the prison guards led me to Volney&#8217;s
bedroom. At the first glance I saw plainly that
he was not long for this world. He lay propped on an
attendant&#8217;s arm, the beautiful eyes serene, an inscrutable
smile on the colourless lips. Beside him sat
Aileen, her hand in his, and on the other side of the
bed the Duke of Cumberland and Malcolm. When he
saw me his eyes brightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;On time, Kenneth. Thanks for coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beauclerc had told me the story, and I went forward
with misty eyes. He looked at me smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;On my soul I believe you are sorry, Montagu.
Yes, I have my quietus. The fellow struck foul. My
own fault! I always knew him for a scoundrel. I
had him beaten; but &#8217;tis better so perhaps. After all
I shall cross the river before you, Kenneth.&#8221; Then
abruptly to an attendant who entered the room, &#8220;Has
the Prince come yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But this moment, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales entered the room, and Volney
gave him his old winsome smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hard hit, your Highness!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust it is not so bad as they say, Robert.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bad or good, as one looks at it, but this night I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
go wandering into the great unknown. Enough of
this. I sent for you, Fritz, to ask my last favour.&#8221;</p>
<p>The face of the stolid Dutchman was all broken
with emotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis yours, Robert, if the thing is mine to grant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want Montagu spared. You must get his pardon
before I die, else I shall not pass easy in mind.
This one wrong I must right before the end. &#8217;Twas
I drove him to rebellion. You will get him pardoned
and see to it that his estates are not confiscated?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I promise to do my best. It shall be attended to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This very hour if it can be arranged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you, Cumberland, will do your share.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Duke nodded, frowning to hide his emotion.</p>
<p>Volney fell back on the pillows. &#8220;Good! Where
is the priest?&#8221;</p>
<p>A vicar of the Church of England came forward to
offer the usual ministrations to the dying. Volney
listened for a minute or two with closed eyes, then interrupted
gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. That will suffice. I&#8217;ll never insult
my Maker by fawning for pardon in the fag hour of a
misspent life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The mercy of God is without limits&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so. That I shall know better than you
within the space of four-and-twenty hours. I&#8217;m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
afraid you mistake your mission here. You came to
marry Antony, not to bury Cæsar.&#8221; Then, turning
to me, he said with a flare of his old reckless wit:
&#8220;Any time this six weeks you&#8217;ve been qualifying for
the noose. If you&#8217;re quite ready we&#8217;ll have the obsequies
to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>He put Aileen&#8217;s hand in mine. The vicar married
us, the Prince of Wales giving away the bride.
Aileen&#8217;s pale face was shot with a faint flush, a splash
of pink in either alabaster cheek. When the priest
had made us man and wife she, who had just married
me, leaned forward impulsively and kissed our former
enemy on the forehead. The humorous gleam came
back to his dulling eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only one, Montagu. I dare say you can spare
that. The rest are for a better man. Don&#8217;t cry,
Aileen. &#8217;Fore Heaven, &#8217;tis a good quittance for
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at the soft warmth and glow of her, now
quickened to throbbing life, drew a long breath, then
smiled and sighed again, her lover even to the last.</p>
<p>A long silence fell, which Sir Robert broke by saying
with a smile, &#8220;In case Selwyn calls show him up.
If I am still alive I&#8217;ll want to see him, and if I&#8217;m dead
he&#8217;ll want to see me. &#8217;Twill interest him vastly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more only he spoke. &#8220;The shadow falls,&#8221; he
said to Aileen, and presently dozed fitfully; so slipped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
gradually into the deeper sleep from which there is no
awakening this side of the tomb. Thus he passed
quietly to the great beyond, an unfearing cynic to the
last hour of his life.</p>

<h3>THE AFTERWORD</h3>
</div>

<p>My pardon came next day, duly signed and
sealed, with the customary rider to it that I
must renounce the Stuarts, and swear allegiance
to King George. I am no hero of romance,
but a plain Englishman, a prosaic lover of roast beef
and old claret, of farming and of fox-hunting. Our
cause was dead, and might as well be buried. Not to
make long of the matter, I took the oath without
scruple. To my pardon there was one other proviso:
that I must live on my estate until further notice. If
at any time I were found ten miles from Montagu
Grange, the pardon was to be void.</p>
<p>Aileen and I moved to our appointed home at once.
It may be believed that our hearts were full of the
most tender joy and love, for I had been snatched
from the jaws of death into the very sunshine of life.
We had but one cloud to mar the bright light&mdash;the
death of many a dear friend, and most of all, of that
friendly enemy who had given his life for her good
name. Moralists point out to me that he was
a great sinner. I care not if it be so. Let others
condemn him; I do not. Rather I cherish the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
memory of a gallant, faultful gentleman whose life
found wrong expression. There be some to whom
are given inheritance of evil nature. Then how dare
we, who know not the measure of their temptation,
make ourselves judges of their sin?</p>
<p>At the Grange we found awaiting us an unexpected
visitor, a red-haired, laughing Highlander, who, though
in hiding, was as full of merriment as a schoolboy
home for the holidays. To Cloe he made most ardent
love, and when, at last, Donald Roy slipped across the
waters to St. Germains, he carried with him a promise
that was redeemed after the general amnesty was
passed.</p>
<p>Six weeks after my pardon Malcolm Macleod and
Miss Flora Macdonald stopped at the Grange for a
short visit with us. They were on their way north,
having been at length released without a trial, since
the passion for blood was now spent.</p>
<p>&#8220;We three, with Captain Donald Roy and Tony
Creagh, came to London to be hangit,&#8221; smiled Major
Macleod as they were about to resume their journey.
&#8220;Twa-three times the rope tightened around the
gullets of some of us, yet in the end we all win free.
You and Tony have already embraced the other
noose; Donald is in a geyan ill way, writing Latin
verses to his lady&#8217;s eyes; and as for me,&#8221;&mdash;he
smiled boldly at his companion&mdash;&#8220;I ride to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
land of heather side by side with Miss Flora Macdonald.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here I drop the quill, for my tale is told. For me,
life is full of many quiet interests and much happiness,
but even now there grips me at times a longing
for those mad wild days, when death hung on a hair&#8217;s
breadth, and the glamour of romance beckoned the
feathered foot of youth.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

opportunities to fix the problem.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
